The following labels and dash tags are used to annotate disfluencies
(Hindle 1983) where necessary.  Disfluences are rare in the PPCHE and
PCEEC and almost entirely restricted to plays in the PPCMBE2.

non-fluencies. In Proceedings of the 21th Annual Meeting of the
Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 123â€“128.

<a name="break">
<h4>BREAK</h4>

BREAK indicates that a phrase or sentence breaks off or is
otherwise left unfinished.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO They))
          (MD could@)
          (NEG @n't)
          (VB believe)
          (CP-THAT (C 0)
	           (IP-SUB (NP-SBJ (PRO we))
                           (VBD saw)
                           (NP-OB1 (D a) (BREAK 0))))
           (PUNC ...)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="elab">
<h4>-ELAB</h4>

The dash tag -ELAB indicates that a parenthetical constituent (one
already bearing a -PRN dash tag) elaborates on its host.  Exact copies
of a constituent are annotated
as <a href="disfluencies.html#rep">repetitions</a> (REP).

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO It))
  	  (BEP is)
	  (NP-PRD (D a) (N trifle)
	  	  (NP-PRN-ELAB (D a) (ADJ mere) (N trifle)))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="fs">
<h4>FS</h4>

FS indicates a false start.  It is the default annotation for
disfluencies.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (FS (PRO They) (PRO they) (PRO they))              &larr; like this
          (NP-SBJ (PRO they))
          (ADVP (ADV really))
          (VBD meant)
          (NP-OB1 (PRO it))
          (PUNC ?)))

( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO They))
          (REP (PRO they) (PRO they) (PRO they))             &larr; not like this
          (ADVP (ADV really))
          (VBD meant)
          (NP-OB1 (PRO it))
          (PUNC ?)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Within a false start, internal structure may be indicated as far as 
feasible, but breaks are not specially indicated.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (FS (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO I))
                      (DOD did@)
		      (NEG @n't)
		      (VB know)))
          (PUNC -)
          (FS (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (CP-FRL (WNP-1 (WPRO what))
	                              (C 0)
			              (IP-SUB (NP-SBJ (PRO I))
			                      (VBP mean)
				              (IP-INF (NP-OB1 *T*-1)
				  	              (TO to)
					              (VB say)))))
                      (BEP is)))
          (NP-SBJ (PRO I))
          (BEP am)
          (ADJP-PRD (ADV very) (ADJ sorry)
	            (IP-INF (TO to)
                            (VB hear)
                            (PP (P of)
			        (NP (PRO$ your) (N loss)))))
          (PUNC .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="rep">
<h4>REP</h4>

REP (in contrast to the dash tag -ELAB) is a full-fledged tag indicating
the exact repetition of a constituent, chiefly for rhetorical reasons.

<p>
In case of ambiguity between REP and FS, FS is the default, as
illustrated <a href="disfluencies.html#fs">earlier</a>.

<p>
Near repetitions are annotated as <a href="disfluencies.html#elab">elaborations</a> (ELAB).

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO It))
  	  (BEP is)
	  (NP-PRD (D a) (N trifle)
	  	  (REP (NP (D a) (N trifle))))
	  (PUNC .)))
</pre>
