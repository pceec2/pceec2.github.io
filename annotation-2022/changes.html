<h3>Changes w.r.t. 2016 annotation guidelines</h3>

<h4>Adjectival vs. verbal participles</h4>

<blockquote>

When modifying nouns or as predicate adjectives, departicipial
adjectives (INTERESTED, INTERESTING) are tagged as ADJ (rather than as
VAG or VAN).

</blockquote>

<h4>AS</h4>

<blockquote>

When functioning as the head of a degree complement, AS is now labelled
P (rather than C).  Its clausal complement bears a dash tag (CP-DEG,
IP-INF-DEG), just as in the corresponding comparative case (CP-CMP).

</blockquote>

<h4><a href="words.html#as_well_as">AS WELL AS</h4>

<blockquote>

The correlative conjunction use of <a href="words.html#as_well_as">AS
WELL AS</a> is now distinguished from its ordinary comparative use
(which remains the default).

</blockquote>

<h4>Comparative and degree complements</h4>

<blockquote>

For both theoretical and practical reasons, <a
href="syn-sub.html#degree_complements">degree complements</a> are now
annotated on a par with of <a
href="syn-sub.html#comparatives">comparative complements</a>.  The
complements of degree and comparative heads, as well as their traces
when extraposed, uniformly attach in the lowest position available to
them <u>in the overt syntax</u>.

<p>
As a result, prenominal SUCH no longer projects an ADJP dominating the
trace of an extraposed degree complement.

</blockquote>

<!--
<h4>Conjunction of unlike categories</h4>

<blockquote>

<a href="syn-conj.html#conj_of_unlike_categories">Conjunction of unlike
categories</a> at the word level now follows the same conventions as for
phrases.

</blockquote>
-->

<h4>Complex tags</h4>

<blockquote>

In the PCEEC, PPCEME, and PPCMBE2, complex tags are generally replaced by
appropriate simple tags.

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td>(NP (ADJ+N gentleman))
<td>(NP (N gentleman))
<tr>
<td>(ADJP (ADVR+ADJ overeager))
<td>(ADJP (ADJ overeager))
<tr>
<td>(PP (Q+BEP+PRO albeit) (CP-ADV ...))
<td>(PP (P albeit) (CP-ADV ...))
<tr>
<td>(ADVP (WADV+ADV however))
<td>(ADVP (ADV however))
<tr>
<td>(WADJP (WADV+ADV however) (ADJ great))
<td>(WADJP (WADV however) (ADJ great))
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
The complex tags are retained, however, if simplifying the tag would
require splitting words or revising higher syntactic labels as well as
in certain other cases.

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td>(D+OTHER another)
<td><u>not</u> (D an@) (OTHER @other)
<tr>
<td>(PP (P+N indeed)
<td><u>not</u> (ADVP (ADV indeed))
<tr>
<td>(NP (Q+ONE everyone))
<td><u>not</u> (NP (Q everyone))
</table>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h4>ELSE</h4>

<blockquote>

When following the head it modifies, ELSE (like ENOUGH) now consistently
projects a phrase (ADJP or ADVP, as appropriate in context) in the
PPCME2 as in the later corpora.

</blockquote>

<h4>ENOUGH</h4>

<blockquote>

When following the head it modifies, ENOUGH (like ELSE) now consistently
projects a phrase (ADJP or ADVP, as appropriate in context) in the
PPCME2 as in the later corpora.

<p>
ENOUGH is labeled ADVR only when it modifies an adjective; otherwise, it
is labeled ADJR, projecting NP-MSR if necessary.

</blockquote>

<h4>Predicate adjective or noun phrases</h4>

<blockquote>

Predicate adjective phrases are explicitly tagged as ADJP-PRD (rather
than as plain ADJP), and predicate noun phrases are tagged as NP-PRD
(rather than as NP-OB1).

</blockquote>

<h4>Punctuation</h4>

<blockquote>

Punctuation (including parentheses and brackets) is uniformly tagged as
PUNC.  As in earlier releases, it is attached as high as possible (not
necessarily where it "belongs").
