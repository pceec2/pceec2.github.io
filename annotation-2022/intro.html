<h4>Philosophy and goals</h4>

<ul>

<li>
Our primary goal has been to create an annotation system that facilitates
automated searches, not to give a correct linguistic analysis of each
sentence.  For instance, if a construction can be found unambiguously
through a combination of properties of a bracketed sentence, our
annotation may not contain all of the structure that a full phrase
structure diagram of the sentence would have.

<p>
<li>
We have tried to plan our system so that at each stage of the
annotation, information is added in a monotonic way.  In particular, we
want any future revisions of the bracketed structures always to add
information, never to change it.  This goal requires us to avoid
subjective judgments.  So, for example, we do not attempt to implement
the argument-adjunct distinction.  In this release, we do, however,
attempt to distinguish between adjectival and verbal passive
participles.

<p>
<li>
As many categories as possible should have clear meanings so that
unclear cases can be relegated to a small number of categories of
residual cases.  The price of making most categories homogeneous is that
these residual categories will not be.  In future revisions of the
corpus, it may be possible to divide some of these residual categories
into homogeneous subcategories.

<p>
<li>
As much as possible, we have avoided making decisions that would be
controversial, whether with regard to text interpretation or to
linguistic theory.  In doubtful cases, we either avoid specifying
structure, or we use default rules to decide the case for search
purposes.  An example of the first strategy concerns VPs.  These are
normally not indicated in the corpus, since VP boundaries are normally
indeterminate.  This is clearly the case in Middle English, which allows
scrambling and where the internal structure of the VP is variable and
changing.  But even in modern English, there are many cases in which it
is not clear whether some phrase attaches as a daughter of VP or higher
up in the tree.  An example of the second strategy concerns PP
attachment.  Whenever it is unclear where a PP attaches, we attach it by
default as high as possible.

</ul>

<a name="file_formats">
<h4>File formats</h4>

Each text in the corpus comes in three different formats, each with a
characteristic filename extension:

<ul>
<li><a href="intro.html#text_files">text</a> (.txt)
<li><a href="intro.html#pos_files">part-of-speech (POS) tagged</a> (.pos)
<li><a href="intro.html#parsed_files">parsed</a> (.psd)
</ul>

<a name="text_files">
<h4>Text files (.txt)</h4>

Text files have the extension .txt.  Besides the text, they contain
<a href="http://khnt.hit.uib.no/icame/manuals/HC/INDEX.HTM#con32"
target="_top">text level codes</a>, inherited from the Helsinki Corpus
and converted into HTML-type codes, as outlined
in <a href="intro.html#text_markup">Text markup</a>.  The original page
layout is not retained.  Rather, the text is divided into tokens, which
generally correspond to a main clause together with any subordinate
clauses that it contains.  Each token is associated with a token ID,
enclosed in parentheses, which contains the name of the file, a page
reference to the printed text (possibly including a volume reference),
and a running token number that locates the token within the computer
file.  Tokens may also consist entirely
of <a href="http://khnt.hit.uib.no/icame/manuals/HC/INDEX.HTM#con32"
target="_top">text level codes</a>.  Such tokens do not have IDs, but
they are counted by the token counter, which can lead to gaps in the
running token numbers.

<p>
Material that has been split or separated in the course of annotation
(punctuation, contractions, cliticized articles, and so on) remains
separated in text files in order to simplify searches and tallies.
See <a href="split-join.html">Splitting and joining words</a> for
details.

<a name="pos_files">
<h4>Part-of-speech (POS) tagged files (.pos)</h4>

Part-of-speech (POS) tagged texts have the extension .pos.  They contain
the material in the text files with a POS tag added to each word.
Editorial material is given the tag <tt>CODE</tt>.  Text elements are
separated from their POS tags; the delimiter is a single space
character.

<p>
The text is divided into tokens in the same way as in the text files.
As mentioned above, tokens consisting entirely of CODE material do not
receive a token ID, but are silently counted by the token counter, and
material that has been split or separated in the course of annotation
(punctuation, contractions, cliticized articles, and so on) remains
separated in the tagged files.  See <a href="split-join.html">Splitting
and joining words</a> for details.

<a name="parsed_files">
<h4>Parsed files (.psd)</h4>

Parsed files have the extension .psd.  They contain a labelled bracketing
of the text, with the first set of labelled parentheses around a word
repeating the information from the POS-tagged files.  The division into
tokens in the parsed files is the same as in the text and POS files.
Each token is enclosed with its ID in a set of unlabelled parentheses.

<h4>Text markup</h4>

In general, it has not been possible to retain the markup conventions of
the Helsinki Corpus in their original form because of conflicts with the
annotation system.  The major changes made are as follows:

<ul>

<li> The representation of the text as printed on the page is not
retained.  The text is presented in main clause units, as described
under <a href="intro.html#file_formats">File formats</a>, rather than line by
line.

<p>
<li>All <a href="http://khnt.hit.uib.no/icame/manuals/HC/INDEX.HTM#con32"
target="_top">text level codes</a> in the text have been changed to
HTML-type codes or omitted as follows:

<b>Editor comments</b> are either omitted or enclosed in
