<h3>Known issues</h3>

This page lists known issues in the annotation of the Penn Parsed
Corpora of Historical English (PPCHE) (with the component corpora below)
and the Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence 2 (PCEEC2):

<ul>
<li>Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English, 2nd edition (PPCME2)
<li>Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME)
<li>Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE)

<a name="adj-ppl">
<dt>Adjectives vs. participles
<dd>Departicipial adjectives in predicate position (<i>They are/seem
interesting/interested</i>) may be mistagged as participles, especially
in the PPCME2.

<a name="according_etc">
<p>
<dt>ACCORDING TO, CONCERNING, TOUCHING, and the like
<dd>These items are annotated and lemmatized inconsistently as
    participles on the one hand as adjectives (ACCORDING) or
    prepositions (CONCERNING, TOUCHING, ...) on the other.

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-conj.html#backwards_gapping">Backwards gapping</a>
<dd>Instances of backwards gapping may be mistagged as
    <a href="syn-conj.html#gapping">ordinary gapping</a>.

<p>
<dt>Complex tags
<dd>Examples in the annotation may contain complex tags that have been simplified
in the corpus.

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-const.html#clause_direct_speech">Direct speech fragments</a>
<dd>Fragments of direct speech may be labelled as <tt>FRAG</tt> rather than <tt>QTP</tt>.

<a name="elided-for">
<p>
<dt>Elided FOR and TO
<dd>Elided FOR and TO in conjunction structures may be missing.

<a name="examples">
<p>
<dt>Examples in the documentation
<dd>Illustrative examples may be inconsistent with the current
    annotation guidelines (reflecting earlier versions of the guidelines
    instead).  In such cases, the guidelines in the text supersede the
    examples.
    <p>
    The running ID numbers in the examples may not match those in the
    corpus due to changes in sentence tokenization.  The page numbers
    are stable, however.
  
<a name="ecm">
<p>
<dt><a href="syn-sub.html#ecm_vs_object_control">Exceptional Case-Marking
    (ECM) versus object control</a>

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-sub.html#infinitival_adjuncts">Infinitival adjuncts</a>
<dd>Infinitival adjuncts may lack the <tt>-ADT</tt> dash tag.

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-const.html#np_measure">Measure phrases</a>
(<tt>NP-MSR, QP</tt>)
<dd>Measure phrase modifiers of nouns may be tagged as <tt>NP-POS</tt>
    rather than <tt>NP-MSR</tt>.
    <br>
    <a href="syn-const.html#np_measure">The distinction between NP-MSR
    and QP</a> is not straightforward, and it is likely that some
    instances of one category are mistagged as the other.  In searches
    for one category, it is wise to include the other.

<a name="ip-ppl">
<p>
<dt><a href="syn-sub.html#rrc_vs_ip-ppl">Participial clauses versus
    reduced relative clauses</a>
<dd>Reduced relatives (<tt>RRC</tt>) headed by participles are not
    always easy to distinguish from 
    <a href="syn-sub.html#participial_clauses">participial clauses</a>
    (<tt>IP-PPL</tt>).  In searches for one category, it is wise to
    include the other.

<p>
<dt><a href="pos-nom.html#proper_nouns">Proper nouns</a>
<dd>Many inconsistencies and outright errors likely remain with respect
    to the tagging of proper nouns (<tt>NPR</tt>).
    <br>
    The guidelines for <a href="pos-nom.html#by_form_the_n_of_np">proper
    nouns of the form <nobr>THE N OF NP</nobr></a> (THE WAR OF THE ROSES)
    have the counterintuitive result that none of the nouns is tagged
    <tt>NPR</tt>.
</table>

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-sub.html#purpose_infinitives">Purpose infinitives</a>
<dd>Purpose infinitives are not always easy to distinguish from bare
    infinitives, and infinitives that should be tagged as purpose
    infinitives may lack the <tt>-PRP</tt> tag, particularly in
    connection with <i>go</i> and <i>send</i>.

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-conj.html#right_node_raising">Right-node raising</a>
<dd>Not all instances of right-node raising are annotated with an index,
    particularly in the statutes.

<p>
<a name="secondary_predication">
<dt>Secondary predication versus small clauses
<dd>It is not always easy to distinguish instances of secondary
    predication from small clauses.  See
    <a href="syn-const.html#sec_pred_np">Secondary predicate NPs</a> for
    a list of predicates that license <tt>NP-SPR, ADJP-SPR</tt>.  See
    <a href="syn-sub.html#small_clauses">Small clauses</a> for a list of
    predicates that license <tt>IP-SMC</tt>.

<p>
<dt><a href="syn-const.html#ob1_ob2_with_like_etc">Single NP object with
    LIKE and similar verbs (LACK, NEED, WANT)</a>
<dd>In the PPCME2, the experiencer argument of LIKE (and similar verbs)
    in the ME LIKE(N) PEARS construction may be mistagged as
    <tt>NP-OB1</tt> rather than <tt>NP-OB2</tt>.
