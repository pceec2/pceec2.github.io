<h4>Ciphers</h4>

<blockquote>

Text used as cipher is tagged as CIPHER in the PCEEC.  In the other
corpora, such text is tagged with its ordinary part of speech (N, NUM).

<a name="collective_nouns">
<h4>Collective nouns</h4>

<blockquote>

See
also <a href="pos-nom.html#singular_collective_and_plural_nouns">Singular,
collective, and plural nouns</a>.

<p> In the PPCME2, collective nouns (FOLK, HORS, PEOPLE, etc.) are
tagged as <tt>N</tt>.  In early texts, before the universalization of
plural -S, it can be quite difficult to distinguish reliably between
singular and plural.  For texts from the Middle English period M1, we
have therefore tried to follow the translation that accompanies the text
used, or when this is lacking, a separate translation.  For details,
consult the information for the individual texts.

<p> In the later corpora, PEOPLE is tagged as singular (<tt>N</tt>) when
preceded by an unambiguously singular determiner (A, THAT, THIS), and as
plural (<tt>NS</tt>) elsewhere.

<a name="quantifiers">
<h4>Comparative and superlative quantifiers</h4>

<blockquote>

In the PPCME2, LESS, LEAST and MUCH, MORE, MOST are generally tagged not
as quantifiers (<tt>Q, QR, QS</tt>), but as adjectives (<tt>ADJ, ADJR,
ADJS</tt>) under conditions
described <a href="differences.html#q_as_adj_ppcme2">below</a>.  The
distinction between the adjectival use and the pure quantifier use is
not always easy to make in a consistent way and becomes more difficult
over time.  In the later corpora, these items are therefore uniformly
tagged as quantifiers (<tt>Q, QR, QS</tt>).

<a name="q_as_adj_ppcme2">
<p> LESS, LEAST and MUCH, MORE, MOST are treated as adjectives (<tt>ADJ,
ADJR, ADJS</tt>) in the PPCME2 under the following conditions.
See <a href="syn-phrase.html#adjp_heads_adj_comparative">Comparative
adjectives as heads of ADJP</a>
and <a href="syn-phrase.html#adjp_heads_adj_superlative">Superlative
adjectives as heads of ADJP</a> for further relevant discussion.

<ul>

<li>When following a determiner or possessive and preceding a noun.
    This includes cases in which a noun has clearly been elided, but
    not comparative constructions like SHE LOVED HIM THE LESS or SHE
    WAS THE MORE MERRY (where the quantifier is either followed by
    nothing or something other than a noun).

<h4>Concessive clauses</h4>

<blockquote>

In the PPCME2, ALL BE IT (THAT) and SO BE IT (THAT) clauses are treated
similarly to <a href="syn-sub.html#v1_conditionals">V1 conditionals</a>.
HOW BE IT (THAT) clauses are treated as adverbial <a href="syn-sub.html#free_relatives">free relatives</a>.

<p> In the later corpora, ALL BE IT and HOW BE IT (though not SO BE IT)
come to be used absolutely.  Moreover, regardless of whether they appear
absolutely or introduce subordinate clauses, these items come to be
spelled as single words (ALBEIT, HOWBEIT).  We therefore treat them as
<a href="words.html#albeit">unitary adverbs or prepositions</a>.  In the
later corpora, SO BE IT clauses cease to pattern with ALL BE IT clauses.
Instead, they are simply word order variants of IT BE SO and are
annotated accordingly.

In Middle English, DO can be ambiguous between a causative
