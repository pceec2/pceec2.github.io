In order for CorpusSearch to run on a parsed corpus, the corpus needs to
satisfy certain formal requirements.

<p>
<a name="complete-parse">
<h3>Complete parse</h3>

CorpusSearch expects sentences to be completely parsed.  In particular,
it expects every terminal node to be uniquely associated with an
immediately dominating annotation label.  The remainder of the structure
must also be a well-formed tree structure.
<!--
If your sentence is only partially parsed, CorpusSearch won't break, but
you won't have any way to search the partially parsed areas of text.
-->

<a name="single">
<h3>Labels must be single words</h3>

CorpusSearch expects labels to be orthographic words - that is, strings
without spaces (" ").  If your intended label contains a space,
CorpusSearch interprets the first string as a label and the next string
as text.  Any subsequent strings (for instance, the actual word in the
text) will trigger a run-time error.  For instance, if you try to use
"PROPER NOUN" as a label, CorpusSearch will interpret "PROPER" as the
label and "NOUN" as text, and then crash on the next item (the actual
noun in the text).  On the other hand, "PROPER_NOUN" with an underscore
instead of space will be properly interpreted as a label and associated
with the next word in the input.

<a name="digits">
<h3>Labels must not begin with digits</h3>

Labels must not begin with digits ("0", "1", ..., "9").  (Such digits
are interpreted as <a href="query-language.html#prefix-indices">prefix
indices</a> left over from a previous search and ignored).  But labels
are allowed to <u>end</u> with digits.  So "PP1" is a legal label, even
though "1PP" is not.

<a name="round">
<h3>Round parentheses</h3>

CorpusSearch expects the matching brackets indicating syntactic
structure to be round parentheses ("(", ")").  If your corpus uses other
sorts of matching brackets to indicate syntactic structure - such as
curly brackets with ("{", "}"), square brackets ("[", "]") or some other
system - you will have to convert them to round parentheses.  By the
same token, if your corpus contains round parentheses as part of the raw
text (the text being annotated, rather than as part of the annotation
system), they will need to be replaced by something like "OPEN-PAREN" or
"LPAREN" or the like for the lefthand variants, and analogously for the
righthand counterparts.  Of course, the sequences that you choose should
not occur elsewhere in the corpus.

<a name="brackets">
<h3>No square brackets</h3>

This item follows from the one immediately preceding, but is repeated
for clarity.  Square brackets ("[" and "]") are used by CorpusSearch to
enclose <a href="query-language.html#prefix-indices">prefix indices</a>.
If your corpus contains square brackets, you will need to convert them
to something like "<open-square-bracket>" or "<left-square-bracket>" or
the like for the lefthand variants, and analogously for the righthand
counterparts.  Of course, the sequences that you choose should not occur
elsewhere in the corpus.

<a name="wrapper-parens">
<h3>Wrapper parens</h3>

CorpusSearch expects every sentence to have a "wrapper", that is, a pair
of unlabeled parentheses surrounding the sentence.  The wrapper is a
useful place to store items that are associated with the sentence, but
not with its internal structure - for instance, <a href="#ID">ID</a>
nodes or sociolinguistic information about the author (the META nodes in
PCEEC).  In the following example, the wrapper consists of the first and
last parentheses:

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP-MAT (ADVP-TMP (ADV Thenne))
          (NP-SBJ (NPR quene) (NPR Igrayne))
          (VBD waxid)
          (ADVP-TMP (ADV dayly))
          (ADJP (ADJR gretter) (CONJ and) (ADJR gretter))
          (. .))
      (ID CMMALORY,5.120))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If necessary, the wrapper parens can be referenced in queries with the
expression "$METAROOT".

<a name="ID">
<h3>ID nodes</h3>

CorpusSearch can function without identification nodes (labelled "ID"),
but it's useful to include them.  For instance, when CorpusSearch
searches the output of a previous search, it uses the ID nodes to keep
statistics for the header, footer and summary blocks.  Here's an example
of an ID node:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(ID CMMALORY,5.120)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here, the CMMALORY identifies the source file, 5 is the page number, and
120 is the running token number for that file.  In general, an ID node
should have this form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(ID &lt;source_name>,&lt;free_space>.&lt;running_token_number>)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
CorpusSearch expects the material following the label "ID" to be a
single orthographic word.  In other words, that material must not
contain spaces (" ").

<p>
The information between "source_name" and "running_token_number" is
actually not referenced by CorpusSearch.  It could be used to store page
numbers (as in the Penn Historical Corpora), or some other information,
or not used at all.  The important thing is that the ID string must
include a comma (which delimits the preceding material as the source
name) and also a period (which delimits the following material as the
running token number).

<p>
CorpusSearch expects to find the ID node just after the sentence, but
inside the sentence <a href="#wrapper-parens">wrapper</a>.

<a name="example">
<h3>Example of a transition</h3>

In 1994, Beatrice Santorini of the University of Pennsylvania built a
corpus of parsed and annotated Yiddish texts.  Like Phase 1 of the
Middle English corpus, this Yiddish corpus was parsed only to the first
level of constituents below the clause level.  In those ancient days,
these structures were retrieved using Perl scripts that matched regular
expressions.

<p>
One passage from the corpus tells a joke that begins this way:  

<blockquote>
<pre> 
When you tell a story to a peasant, he laughs three times. 
The first time, he laughs when someone tells him the story.  
The second time, when it is explained to him.  
And the third time, when he understands the story.
</pre>
</blockquote>

Let's examine one sentence from that passage:

<blockquote>
<pre>
The first time, he laughs when someone tells him the story.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here it is as it appears in the corpus.  (For this discussion, we don't
need the definitions of the words and their labels, so they are omitted.
Most of the labels in this corpus begin with lowercase letters.  This is
unorthodox, but entirely compatible with CorpusSearch's formal requirements.)

<blockquote>
<pre>
( [t dem ershtn mol ]
  [v0 lakht ] 
  [s er ] 
  ,
  [B [c ven ] [s men ] [v0 dertseylt ] [i im ] [d di mayse ] , B]
)
(RO,1)
</pre>
</blockquote>

The first problem is the use of square brackets ("[", "]") to represent
syntactic structure, which CorpusSearch doesn't recognize (or rather,
would want to interpret as prefix indices).  So the first task is to
convert the square brackets to round parentheses.  At the same time,
let's close up the space between the words and the close parens:

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (t dem ershtn mol)
  (v0 lakht)
  (s er)
  ,
  (B (c ven) 
     (s men)
     (v0 dertseylt)
     (i im)
     (d di mayse)
     , 
  B)
)
(RO,1)
</pre>
</blockquote>

The second problem is that the sentence isn't delimited by wrapper
parens.  (The outermost parens enclose the sentence, but CorpusSearch
expects a further pairs of parens.)  The following structure has the
wrapper parens; we've also added a dummy label to the original highest
parens.

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP (t dem ershtn mol)
      (v0 lakht)
      (s er)
      ,
      (B (c ven) 
         (s men)
         (v0 dertseylt)
        (i im)
        (d di mayse)
        , 
      B))
  (RO,1))
</pre>
</blockquote>

This form of the sentence can be partly searched by CorpusSearch.  For
instance, this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*
query:  (v0 iPrecedes s)
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds the structure (v0 lakht) (s er), as expected.

<p>
But the sentence is still not completely parsed.  For instance, the
phrase "dem ershtn mol" ('the first time') has been parsed as one
object.  So if you run this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*
query:  (ershtn precedes mol) 
</pre>
</blockquote>

CorpusSearch (if it runs at all) will not find the sentence.  This is
because CorpusSearch expects every terminal node in the tree to be
uniquely associated with an immediately dominating annotation label.
<!-- Any extra information will be stored as part of the node but it
will usually not be examined by the search functions.  These extra
pieces of information (in this case, the strings "ershtn" and "mol")
behave as useless baggage that is carried along by the sentence vector
but never opened.
--> 
Also, the leading "B" on the parenthesis that marks the end of the
B-labelled clause is redundant.

<p>
We therefore remove the leading "B" and give each terminal a tag of its
own.  In the following structure, we have given the punctuation marks
linguistically appropriate tags, and we have given the words without
tags of their own the dummy tag "x", which is enough to keep
CorpusSearch from complaining.  (Eventually, of course, we might want to
replace those tags with linguistically appropriate ones, but that is
independent of whether CorpusSearch will run properly on the corpus and
give results as expected.  It is worth noting that much fine research
can be - and has been done - on structures like the one immediately
following.)

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (IP (t (x dem) (x ershtn) (x mol))
      (v0 lakht)
      (s er) 
      (, ,)
      (B (c ven)
         (s men) 
         (v0 dertseylt)
         (i im) 
         (d (x di) (x mayse))
         (. ,)))
 (RO,1))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, there is the node (RO,1), which identifies the sentence as part
of the first story in the Royte Pomerantsen collection.  In connection
with adding the wrapper parens, we have already correctly included the
node inside the wrapper parens, but it still needs to be given the
standard CorpusSearch <a href="#ID">ID node form</a>.  As it stands,
there is no running token number associated with the sentence.  For
purposes of illustration, we've manually added the number 2:

<p>
Now the annotation is fully compatible with CorpusSearch, and the
following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*
query:  (ershtn precedes mol) 
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds the structure as expected: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
dem ershtn mol lakht er , ven men dertseylt im di mayse ,
*~/

/*
    1 t: 3 x ershtn, 4 x mol
*/

( (IP (t (x dem) (x ershtn) (x mol))
      (v0 lakht)
      (s er)
      (, ,)
      (B (c ven)
         (s men)
         (v0 dertseylt)
         (i im)
         (d (x di) (x mayse))
         (. ,)))
  (ID RO,1.2))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Further revisions to this structure - for instance, moving the final
punctuation up a level (out of the B clause) - would make it compatible
with standard annotation guidelines.  These and other linguistically
more interesting revisions can be performed automatically using
CorpusSearch's <a href="revision.html">corpus revision</a>
functionality.  But they are not necessary for compatibility with
CorpusSearch's purely formal requirements.
