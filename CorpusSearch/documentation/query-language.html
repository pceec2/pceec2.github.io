<h3>Basic components</h3>

Queries in the CorpusSearch query language are built from the following
basic components:

<ul>
<li><a href="search-functions.html">search function calls</a>, which look
    for basic relationships among nodes, such as "dominates" or "precedes".
<li><a href="search-functions.html">arguments to search function
    calls</a>, which describe the nodes involved in the relationships being
    searched for.
<li><a href="#log-ops">logical operators</a>, which are used as in basic
    formal logic.
</ul>

<a name="search">
<h3>Search function calls</h3>

The most basic query consists of a
single <a href="search-functions.html">search function call</a> with
associated arguments.  For instance, the following query searches for
nodes labelled NP-PRD ("predicate noun phrase") that immediately
dominate nodes labelled N ("noun"):

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP-PRD iDominates N)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here is a sentence that matches the query.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
For he 's a jolly good fellow.
*~/

/*
    1 IP-MAT: 9 NP-SBJ, 16 N
*/

(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ For)
             (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
             (7 BEP 's)
             (9 NP-PRD (10 D a) (12 ADJ jolly) (14 ADJ good) (16 N fellow)))
             (18 . .))
</pre>
</blockquote>

Search function calls can be combined using <a href="#log-ops">logical
operators</a>.  CorpusSearch's search functions are described in detail
in <a href="search-functions.html">their own chapter</a>.

<a name="log-ops">
<h3>Logical operators</h3>

<p>
CorpusSearch provides two types of logical operators:
<ul>
<li><a href="#search-function-operators">Search function
    operators</a> combine search functions.
<li><a href="#argument-operators">Argument operators</a> act
    on the arguments to search functions.
</ul>

<a name="search-function-operators">
<h3>Search function operators</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="#AND">AND</a>
<li><a href="#OR">OR</a> <font color="red">(deprecated)</font>
<li><a href="#NOT">NOT</a> <font color="red">(deprecated)</font>
</ul>

<a name="AND">
<h3>AND</h3>

AND returns trees in which both conjuncts hold within a single boundary
node.  For instance, this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*

query:     (NP-TMP* iDoms ADV*)
       AND (TO iPrecedes VB)
</pre>
</blockquote>

yields this output:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
4 IP-INF-SBJ:  5 NP-TMP, 6 ADV+NS, 8 TO, 10 VB

(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ but)
             (4 IP-INF-SBJ (5 NP-TMP (6 ADV+NS oftymes))
                           (8 TO to)
                           (10 VB rede)
                           (12 NP-OB1 (13 PRO it)))
             (15 MD shal)
             (17 VB cause)
             (19 NP-OB1 (20 PRO it))
             (22 IP-INF (23 ADVP (24 ADV wel))
                        (26 TO to)
                        (28 BE be)
                        (29 VAN vnderstande))
          (31 E_S /))
   (33 ID CMREYNAR,6.10))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="OR">
<h3>OR</h3>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>OR is not yet fully tested and is likely to yield unexpected
results.  Its functionality can normally be achieved with argument "or".
When argument "or" is not sufficient, <a href="coding.html">coding
queries</a> will achieve the desired effect.</b>
</table>

<p>
OR encodes inclusive disjunction. "(FOO) OR (BAR)" returns all subtrees
rooted in an instance of the query's selected node boundary with either
the property "FOO" or the property "BAR" or <b>both</b>. "FOO" and "BAR"
may consist of single search functions or may themselves be built up out
of conjunctions, disjunctions and negations of simple search functions.

<a name="NOT">
<h3>NOT</h3>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>NOT is not yet fully tested.  It does not yet work correctly
in any but the simplest cases and should be avoided except for testing
purposes.  Its functionality can be achieved
with <a href="coding.html">coding queries</a>, notably via the ELSE

</table>

<p>
NOT returns trees rooted in the node boundary that do not contain the
described structure.  It differs from <a href="#bang">argument "not"</a>
in that none of the arguments need to appear in the domain defined by
the boundary node.

<p>
For instance, 

<blockquote>
<pre>
NOT(NP* iPrecedes VB*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns trees that do not contain the structure "(NP* iPrecedes
VB*)", including those that contain neither NP* nor VB*.

<p>
By contrast,

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* iPrecedes !VB*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns trees that contain an NP* which does not iPrecede VB*.

<a name="argument-operators">
<h3>Argument operators</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="#pipe">Argument "or"</a> ("|", read "pipe")
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#pipe-list">Argument "or" negates lists</a>
    </ul>
<li><a href="#bang">Argument "not"</a> ("!", read "bang")
    <ul>
    <li><a href="#bang-one">One argument "not" per search function</a>
    <li><a href="#bang-index">Argument "not" before prefix indices</a>
    </ul>
</ul>

<a name="pipe">
<h3>Argument "or"</h3>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>Two consecutive pipes ("| |") will abort any search.  The pipes may
    be in the command file, or in a file called by the command file,
    such as a <a href="def.html">definition file</a>
    or <a href="pref.html">preference file</a>.
</table>

Any number of arguments to a search function may be linked together into
a list using "|" (argument "or" or "pipe").  For instance,

<blockquote>
<pre>
(BE*|DO*|HV*|MD|VB* iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

means "BE* or DO* or HV* or MD or VB* immediately precedes NP-SBJ*",  
and will find sentences like this:

<blockquote>

   (18 ID CMKEMPE,2.12))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="pipe-list">
<h4>Argument "or" negates lists</h4>

"!" cannot be used to negate members of a list constructed with "|", and
queries of the following form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(BE*|!HV* iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

will abort.  Instead, "!" must precede the list, and it is interpreted
as negating the entire list (not just the first member).  So the
following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(!BE*|DO*|HV*|MD|VB* iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

means "none of the list 'BE* or DO* or HV* or MD or *VB*' iPrecedes NP-SBJ*",
and it finds sentences like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>

      (22 ID CMKEMPE,3.34))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="bang">
<h3>Argument "not"</h3>

"!" (argument "not" or "bang") negates a single argument to a search
function.  For instance, suppose you're looking for sentences with
subjects that do not immediately dominate a pronoun.  The following
query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP-SBJ* iDoms !PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds the examples in question.

<blockquote>

             (27 E_S .))
      (29 ID CMHORSES,87.17))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="bang-one">
<h4>One argument "not" per search function</h4>

CorpusSearch does not allow you to negate both arguments to a single
search function.  So queries of the following form will abort:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(!NP-SBJ* iPrecedes !VBD)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Queries of the following form are fine.  It's true that the entire query
contains more than one "!" operator, but each individual search function
(iDoms, iPrecedes) contains only one.

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (NP-SBJ* iDoms !PRO*)
AND (NP-SBJ* iPrecedes !VBD)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="bang-index">
<h4>Argument "not" before prefix indices</h4>

If you need to use both "!" and <a href="#prefix-indices">prefix
indices</a>, "!"  goes before the indices.  This makes sense because the
prefix index tells CorpusSearch which node is meant, and then "!" tells
CorpusSearch to exclude that node from the output.

<p>
For instance, suppose you're looking for sentences with a subject that
precedes the object, and where neither the subject nor the object is a
pronoun.  The following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (NP-SBJ* precedes NP-OB1*)
AND (NP-SBJ* iDoms ![1]PRO*)
AND (NP-OB1* iDoms ![2]PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

will find sentences like this one:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*

/*
1 IP-MAT: 4 NP-SBJ, 11 NP-OB1, 5 D +tat, 16 N hors

             (9 BE be)
             (11 NP-OB1 (12 D a) (14 ADJ good) (16 N hors))
             (18 E_S .))
   (20 ID CMHORSES,85.9))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="reg-exps">
<h3>Regular expressions</h3>

CorpusSearch allows the use of basic regular expression syntax in the
arguments to functions, but does not support full regular expression
syntax.  (This is because of weaknesses in Java, the language
CorpusSearch is written in.)

<a name="regexp-square">
<h4>Square brackets</h4> 

The use of square brackets discussed in what follows is distinct from
their use in connection with <a href="#prefix-indices">prefix
indices</a>.  As the name implies, prefix indices precede node labels.
The square brackets discussed here occur as part of the node labels
themselves.

<p>
Expressions enclosed in square brackets specify alternatives.  For
instance, "[xyz]" stands for a single character that is either an "x", a
"y", or a "z". (Alternatively, one could express the search as "x|y|z".
Similarly, "BED|BEP" and "BE[DP]" amount to the same.)

<p>
Ranges such as "[A-Z]", "[a-z]", and "[0-9]" must be expressed as
complete lists of alternatives (for instance, "[0123456789]").  In other
words, CorpusSearch doesn't provide the full range of regular
expressions as you get with UNIX commands.

<a name="regexp-period">
<h4>Period</h4>

The wildcard character "." (period) matches any letter or digit.

<a name="regexp-asterisk">
<h4>Asterisk</h4>  

The wildcard character "*" (asterisk) matches any string, including the
null string.  "*" may be used anywhere in the string specifying the
function argument - beginning, middle or end.  For instance, "CP*"
matches any label beginning with the letters "CP" ("CP", "CP-ADV",
"CP-QUE-SPE", etc.).  "*-SPE" matches any label ending in "-SPE", and
*hersum* matches any string containing the substring "hersum"
("hersumnesse", "unhersumnesse", etc.).

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>"NP*" matches all types of noun phrases ("NP-SBJ", "NP-OB1", etc.),
but also "NPR" and its variants.  The latter matches are not usually
intended.  To avoid this problem, either add a hyphen ("NP-*") or
introduce appropriate definitions in a <a href="def.html">definition
file</a>.
</table>

<p>
As mentioned above, regular expression support in Java is not perfect.
In particular, after square brackets, ".*" and "*" behave erratically.  

<blockquote>
<pre>
gi[uv]*            &larr; matches "giv", but not "give", "given" (the asterisk is unexpectedly inert)

gi[uv].*           &larr; matches "give", "given", but not "giv" (the asterisk unexpectedly disallows zero instances of the wildcard period)
</pre>
</blockquote>

In general, ".*" after square bracket gives the desired result, but
refuses to match zero instances of the wildcard character ".", contrary
to expectation.  If those matches are important, searches need to
include disjunctions along the following lines (here, the first disjunct
doesn't contain an asterisk, since including it is both unnecessary and
confusing):

<blockquote>
<pre>
gi[uv]|gi[uv].*    &larr; matches "giv", "give", "given"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="escaping">
<a name="esc-asterisk">
<h3>Escaping special expressions</h3>

<h4>Asterisk</h4> 

As just discussed, "*" is ordinarily interpreted as a wildcard
character.  In searches for "*" as a literal character in the text, the
wildcard interpretation needs to be turned off or "escaped".  The
standard way of doing this is by prefixing the asterisk with a backslash
("\").  For instance, the following query with unescaped asterisks:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates *con*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

will find noun phrases that dominate the word "contradiction" or
"unconstitutional" or "Rubicon".  If the search is to be restricted to
noun phrases with subjects elided under conjunction ("*con*"), where the
asterisks are part of the text, the asterisks need to be escaped:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates \*con\*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

It is also possible to enclose literal asterisks in square brackets
("[*]") to escape the operator interpretation.

<p>
Escaped and unescaped asterisks can be - and very often are - combined
in a single search.  For instance, here are two alternative ways to
search for traces of the form "*T*-1", "*T*-2", etc.  The two queries
are not completely equivalent.  The first form finds only traces with
indices, whereas the second form would also find "*T*" (i.e., traces
that are incorrectly missing an index).

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* dominates \*T\*-*)

(NP* dominates \*T*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Empty categories in general (which always begin with an asterisk in the
PPCHE) can be searched for with "\**".

<a name="esc-period">
<h4>Period</h4>

Given what was just said about asterisks, one would expect to be able
conduct literal searches for period by prefixing it with a backslash
<nobr>("\.")</nobr> or enclosing it in square
brackets <nobr>("[.]").</nobr>  Neither of these alternatives give the
desired result, however.

<p> The workaround is to replace the period character in the corpus by
some suitable sequence such as "PERIOD" or more safely (to safeguard
against the replacement expression itself occurring in the corpus), by
"P-E-R-I-O-D" or "D-O-T".

<a name="esc-integer">
<h4>Integers</h4>

Integer arguments are expected for some search functions, but not
allowed for others.  For instance, "exists" doesn't take an integer
argument, and so the following query crashes.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (1929 exists)           &larr;  CRASH !
</pre>
</blockquote>

To find tokens containing "1929", the integer needs to be escaped with
with a backslash ("\") in the query.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (\1929 exists)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="same-instance">
<h3>Same instance</h3>

If a CorpusSearch query contains (exactly) the same label more than
once, CorpusSearch assumes by default that each occurrence of the label
refers to the same node in the tree, and we say that CorpusSearch
enforces <b>"same instance".</b>  Thus, the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (ADVP precedes HV*|MD|VB*)
AND (HV*|MD|VB* precedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

matches tokens with an adverb preceding a modal, and that same modal
preceding a subject.

<p>
"Same instance" is triggered by strings that are identical character by
character.  Strings that are not character-by-character identical do not
trigger "same instance", even if the strings are logically equivalent.
For instance, the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    (ADVP precedes HV*|MD|VB*)          &larr; HV* &lt; MD
AND (MD|HV*|VB* precedes NP-SBJ*)       &larr; MD &lt; HV*
</pre>
</blockquote>

matches tokens with an adverb preceding a modal in one clause and a form
of HAVE preceding a subject in some other clause.  (It also matches the
tokens returned by the first query.)  The reason that "same instance"
isn't enforced in the second query is that "HV*" and "MD" appear in
different orders in the two clauses of the query.

<p>
When search expressions become complex, it rapidly becomes difficult to
tell whether they are character-by-character identical and whether they
will trigger "same instance" or not.  This is one of the many reasons
that it is good practice to use <a href="def.html">definition files</a>.

<a name="prefix-indices">
<h3>Prefix indices</h3>

Certain queries require <u>not</u> triggering "same instance".  For
instance, if you are searching for two sister noun phrases, the
following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
NP hasSister NP
</pre>
</blockquote>

will not give the desired result.  In fact, it will not generate any
hits at all because "hasSister" is not defined as a reflexive relation
(in other words, a node isn't its own sister).

<p>
When it is necessary to avoid "same instance" interpretations, the
intended reference of arguments needs to be explicitly specified with
<b>prefix indices</b>, as in the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
([1]NP* hasSister [2]NP*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Prefix indices are enclosed by square brackets ("[", "]").  Arguments
with the same index must refer to the same node (in other words, they
explicitly trigger "same instance").  Arguments with distinct indices
must refer to distinct nodes.

<p>
As with "same instance", labels that are intended to refer to distinct
nodes in the tree must be character-by-character identical (except for
the prefix index).

<p>
Here is a slightly more complex example of a query with prefix indices:

<blockquote>
<pre>
    ([1]NP* hasSister [2]NP*) 
AND ([1]NP* iDoms [3]PRO)
AND ([2]NP* iDoms [4]PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This query finds sentences with two sister NPs, each of which
immediately dominates (its own) PRO.

<blockquote>
<pre>

                                     (23 NS repreuynges)
                                     (25 CONJP (26 CONJ and)
                                               (28 NX (29 NS scornes))))
                          (31 PP (32 P for)
                                 (34 NP (35 PRO vs)))))
      (36 ID CMMANDEV,1.4))
</pre>
</blockquote>

If the prefix indices on the two instances of PRO were omitted, the
search would generate no hits, since it would be requiring one and the
same PRO node to be the child of the two distinct NP nodes.

Here's a final example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (IP-SMC iDoms [1]NP*) AND ([1]NP* iDoms [3]\**)
   AND (IP-SMC iDoms [2]NP*) AND ([2]NP* iDoms [4]\**)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This query searches for an IP-SMC node which immediately dominates two
distinct NP* nodes, each immediately dominating (its own) trace.  The
two mentions of "IP-SMC" must refer to the same node in the tree
(because "same instance" is enforced by default).  But "[1]NP*" and
"[2]NP*" must refer to different nodes (because of the distinct prefix
indices), and the same for the traces "[3]\**" and "[4]\**".

<p>
The above query finds sentences like this one:
<blockquote>
<pre>
