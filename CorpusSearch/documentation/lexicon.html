<h3>What is a lexicon?</h3>

A lexicon is a list of the words occurring in a file or corpus.
Following each word is the total number of times the word is found,
followed by the part-of-speech labels associated with the word and the
number of times the word is found with each part of speech.

<p>
For instance, the line:

<blockquote>
<pre>
a-boute 11: [9 P] [1 RP] [1 ADV]
</pre>
</blockquote>

means that the word "a-boute" was found a total of 11 times, 9 times
with the part of speech label "P", 1 time with the part of speech label
"RP", and 1 time with the part of speech label "ADV".

<p>
CorpusSearch determines word identity by spelling.  Spellings that vary
only by capitalization or by the presence of the initial "$" that
indicates editorial emendations in the PPCHE are listed on the same line.

<blockquote>
<pre>
zoroaster Zoroaster ZOROASTER 57: [57 NPR]

is Is IS $is 10689: [10689 BEP]
</pre>
</blockquote>

Otherwise, CorpusSearch performs no spelling normalization or
morphological analysis.

<a name="make_lexicon">
<h3>make_lexicon</h3>

This is the basic command that causes a lexicon to be built.  A query
file containing only the following command generates a lexicon including
every word in the input file(s).

<blockquote>
<pre>
make_lexicon: t
</pre>
</blockquote>

Like any other command file, a lexicon query must end in <b>.q</b> and
writes output to an <b>.out</b> file.  But lexicon queries do not
contain a boundary node.

<a name="pos_labels">
<h3>pos_labels</h3>

The lexicon can be restricted to words with certain part-of-speech tags.
For instance, the following query creates a list of all words labelled
as verbs or modals:

<blockquote>
<pre>
make_lexicon: t

pos_labels: MD*|V*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="text_labels">
<h3>text_labels</a></h3>

The lexicon can be restricted to certain words in the text.  For
instance, the following query finds all words beginning with "th" or
"+t":

<blockquote>
<pre>
make_lexicon: t

text_labels: [tT]h*|+[tT]*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
A single query can contain both pos_labels and text_labels.  For
instance, the following query lists all verbs ending in "[eiy]th" or "[eiy]+t":

<blockquote>
<pre>
make_lexicon: t

pos_labels: V*

text_labels: *[eiy]th|*[eiy]+t
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="sample-output">
<h3>Sample output</h3>

Here is sample output that results from running "make_lexicon" on the
PPCME2.  For reasons of space, much of the actual output is omitted.
