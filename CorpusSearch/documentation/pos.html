<h3>Formatting conventions for POS-tagged corpora</h3>

CorpusSearch can search files that are tagged for part of speech but not
further parsed for syntactic structure.  In this section, the special
formatting conventions for POS-tagged files are first discussed and then
illustrated in a <a href="#template">template file</a>.

<p>
Because CorpusSearch expects its input to be in Penn Treebank format by
default, POS-tagged files must be specially flagged.  This is done by
including a format flag as the first line of the POS-tagged file, as
illustrated below:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#!FORMAT=POS_1
</pre>
</blockquote>

This first line may be followed by philological or other header
information.  The beginning of the text to be searched is indicated by
the following delimiter:

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;text>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Thereafter, the file must contain word/tag pairs formatted according to
standard conventions.  Space functions as the delimiter between word/tag
pairs, so neither words nor tags can themselves contain spaces.  The
delimiter between a word and its tag is "/" (forward slash).

<p>
The delimiter between sentences is a blankline.  In addition, every
sentence must end with a sentence-final punctuation tag.  By default,
this tag is "." (period).  Alternatively, the sentence-final punctuation
tag may be "PONFP".  The PONFP alternative must be indicated in the
file-initial format line by replacing the default "POS_1" format by
"POS_0".  The "word" associated with the sentence-final punctuation tag
needn't be a period.  See the <a href="#template">template</a> file for
examples.

<p>
Sentence-internal punctuation is also treated as a word/tag pair, but
the tag must differ from the sentence-final punctuation tag, as
illustrated in the following examples, which distinguish "," (comma) and
"." (period) or PON and PONFP.

<blockquote>
<pre>
After/P the/D party/N ,/, we/PRO all/Q went/VBD back/ADV ./.

Après/P la/D fête/N ,/PON nous/PRO sommes/BEP tous/Q retornés/VBN ./PONFP
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, the end of the text is indicated by the closing counterpart of the
opening &lt;text> delimiter:

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;/text>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="template">
<h3>Template file</h3>

The following template file illustrates the formatting conventions just
discussed, using the POS_0 alternative.

<blockquote>
<pre>
#!FORMAT=POS_0

This file contains the best edition of the "Chanson de Roland",
with emendations by Christiane Marchello-Nizia as noted.

&lt;text>

word1/tag1 word2/tag2 word3/tag3 .... ./PONFP

word1/tag1 word2/tag2 word3/tag3 .... ?/PONFP

word1/tag1 word2/tag2 word3/tag3 .... ,/PONFP

.
.
.

&lt;/text>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="search-functions">
<h3>Search functions</h3>

CorpusSearch treats POS-tagged files as containing sentences parsed with
a completely flat structure, with every word/tag pair as an immediate
daughter of the root node.  Query files for POS-tagged corpora are
therefore essentially the same as for parsed corpora.  In particular:

<ul>
<li>The node boundary in queries for POS-tagged files is always $ROOT.
<li>The tag for a word is treated as its mother.  In other words, a
query like "(N iDoms king)" returns sentences containing the word/tag
pair "king/N".
<li>Because of the flat structure of a POS-tagged file, many
CorpusSearch functions cannot be used.  The table of contents for the
chapter lists those that are ordinarily appropriate.
<li>The <a href="#neighborhood">Neighborhood</a> function works only on
POS-tagged files.
</ul>

<a name="exists">
<h3>exists (variant: Exists)</h3>

Exists searches for a POS tag or text anywhere in the sentence.  For
instance, this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (MD0 exists)
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds this sentence:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
I shal not conne wel goo thyder ./. (ID CMREYNAR,14.261)
*~/

/*
    4 MD0 conne
*/

( (PRO I) (MD shal) (NEG not) (MD0 conne) (ADV wel) (VB goo) (ADV thyder)
  (ID CMREYNAR,14.261) )
</blockquote>
</pre>

<a name="iDominates">
<h3>iDominates (variants: idominates, iDoms, idoms)</h3>

As mentioned above, POS tags immediately dominate the words of the text.
So this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:     (PRO iDominates he)
       AND (FP iDominates ane)
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds this sentence:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
Sythen he ledes +tam by +tar ane,
(CMROLLEP,118.978)
*~/

/*
    2 PRO he, 7 FP ane
*/
( (ADV Sythen) (PRO he) (VBP ledes) (PRO +tam) (P by) (PRO$ +tar) (FP ane) (. ,) 
  (CMROLLEP,118.978) )

/*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="iPrecedes">
<h3>iPrecedes (variants: iprecedes, iPres, ipres)</h3>

<tt>iPrecedes</tt> is true if and only if its first argument immediately
precedes its second argument in the sentence.  So this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:     (as iPrecedes sone) 
       AND (sone iPrecedes P)
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds this sentence:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and as sone as he myght he toke his horse .
(CMMALORY,206.3401)
*~/
/*
2 as, 3 sone, 4 P as
*/

( (CONJ and) (ADVR as) (ADV sone) (P as) (PRO he) (MD myght) (PRO he)
  (VBD toke) (PRO$ his) (N horse) (. .)
  (CMMALORY,206.3401) )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="neighborhood">
<h3>neighborhood (variant: Neighborhood)</h3>

The <tt>neighborhood</tt> function is available only for POS-tagged
files.  It takes three arguments - two words or tags and a number - and
searches for sentences in which the two words/tags are separated from
each other by the specified number of words (or fewer). For instance,
this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (whoreson neighborhood 2 wilt)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns all tokens in the corpus in which the word "whoreson" is
separated from the word "wilt" by at most two words, as in the following
sentence:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
why thou whoreson when wilt thou be maried?
(DELONEY,79.296)
*~/
/*
3 whoreson,  5 wilt
*/

( (WADV why) (PRO thou) (N whoreson) WADV when) (MD wilt) (PRO thou) (BE be) (VAN maried)  (. ?)
  (ID DELONEY,79.296) )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="precedes">
<h3>precedes (variants: Precedes, Pres, pres)</h3> 

<tt>precedes</tt> imposes a less strict condition
than <tt>iPrecedes</tt>.  <tt>x precedes y</tt> means "x comes before y
in the sentence but not necessarily immediately".

<p>
Example query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (VB precedes N)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Example output:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
thenne have ye cause to make myghty werre upon hym.
(CMMALORY,2.25)
*~/

/*
    6 VB make, 8 N werre
*/

( (ADV thenne) (HV have) (PRO ye) (N cause) (TO to) (VB make) (ADJ myghty) (N werre) (P upon)
  (PRO hym) (. .)
  (ID CMMALORY,2.25))
</pre>
</blockquote>
