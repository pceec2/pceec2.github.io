<a name="introduction">
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In this section, we present the most usual type of a CorpusSearch
command file: the ordinary query file.  Other types of command files are
similar in form, but have different functions, and it is convenient to
discuss them separately:

<ul>
<li><a href="coding.html">Coding</a>
<li><a href="revision.html">Corpus revision</a>
<li><a href="lexicon.html">Lexicon creation</a>
<li><a href="frames.html">Local frames</a>
</ul>

Ordinary query files must have names ending in the extension <b>.q</b>.
By default, their output has the same basename as the query file, but
the extension is <b>.out</b>.  The basename of the output file (but not
the .out extension) can be
changed <a href="installing.html#out-switch">with an "-out" switch</a>
on the command line.

<a name="preamble">
<p>
The command file for an ordinary CorpusSearch query has the following
schematic form.  Obligatory components are underlined:

<ul>
<li>Preamble
    <ul>
    <li><u>Node specification</u>
    <li>"Ignore" commands
    <li>Output format commands
    <li>Reference to a <a href="def.html">definition file</a>
    </ul>
<li><u>Command specification</u>
</ul>

<p>
The various components of the preamble can appear in any order.  They
are read in order.  This means that the node specification can reference
a label from a <a href="def.html">definition file</a>, but only if
"define:" precedes "node:" in the command file.

<p>
The commands in the preamble must all precede the search specification.
</ul>

<a name="boolean">
<h3>Notational variants for Boolean values</h3>

CorpusSearch allows the following notational variants for Boolean values:

<blockquote>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td>true
<td>t, true, T, TRUE
<tr>
<td>false
<td>f, false, F, FALSE
</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="node">
<a name="root">
<a name="metaroot">
<h3>Node specification</h3>

The "node" command specifies the search domain within which CorpusSearch
attempts to execute the search specification.  Possible values for the
node specification are:

<ul>
<li>$ROOT, a variable that stands for the root node of a sentence token,
    whatever its label may be and even when it has no
    label. (See <a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a> for the effect of
    that command on the value of $ROOT in subsequent searches.)
<p>
<li>$METAROOT, the mother of $ROOT, which generally has no label.  A
    common use for $METAROOT is to check whether every sentence token
    has an associated ID node.
<p>
<li>a literal label in the corpus
<p>
<li>a <a href="query-language.html#reg-exps">regular expression</a>
    referring to a set of labels in the corpus
<p>
<li>an expression defined in the <a href="def.html">definition file</a>
    (in this case, "define:" must precede "node:" in the preamble)
</ul>

The choice of node boundary determines the following:

<ul>
<li>how hits are counted, hits being defined as "number of distinct node
    boundaries matching the query"
<li>which nodes are removed if <a href="#remove_nodes">remove_nodes</a>
    is true
<li>which nodes are printed if <a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a> is true
</ul>

We illustrate this by running the same query on the same simple
sentence, but with different node boundaries.  Given the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP-MAT*

query: (NP* iDoms PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

CorpusSearch counts 1 hit because even though there are 2 NP* nodes that
match the query, they are contained within a single instance of IP-MAT*.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY,2.13)
*~/
/*
1 IP-MAT:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO
1 IP-MAT:  9 NP-OB2, 10 PRO
*/
(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ and)
	     (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
	     (7 VBD made)
	     (9 NP-OB2 (10 PRO them))
	     (12 NP-OB1 (13 ADJ grete) (15 N chere))
	     (17 ADVP (18 ADV out)
		      (20 PP (21 P of)
			     (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
  (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13)) 

/*
SUMMARY:  
source files, hits/tokens/total
  CMMALORY			1/1/1
whole search, hits/tokens/total
				1/1/1
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

Running the same query with node boundary NP* yields a different result:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: NP*

query: (NP* iDoms PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Now CorpusSearch counts 2 hits, because each of the 2 instances of NP*
is an instance of the node boundary:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY,2.13)
*~/
/*
4 NP-SBJ:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO
9 NP-OB2:  9 NP-OB2, 10 PRO
*/
(0 (1 IP-MAT (2 CONJ and)
	     (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
	     (7 VBD made)
	     (9 NP-OB2 (10 PRO them))
	     (12 NP-OB1 (13 ADJ grete) (15 N chere))
	     (17 ADVP (18 ADV out)
	              (20 PP (21 P of)
		             (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
    (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13))
/*
SUMMARY:  
source files, hits/tokens/total
  CMMALORY		2/1/1
whole search, hits/tokens/total
			2/1/1
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

The way that CorpusSearch counts hits in this case becomes particularly
clear if we set "<a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a>" to "true":

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: NP*

nodes_only: t

query: (NP* iDoms PRO*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This yields the following output:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
and he made them grete chere out of mesure
(CMMALORY,2.13)
*~/
/*
4 NP-SBJ:  4 NP-SBJ, 5 PRO
9 NP-OB2:  9 NP-OB2, 10 PRO
*/
( (4 NP-SBJ (5 PRO he))
  (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13)) 

( (9 NP-OB2 (10 PRO them))
  (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13)) 
/*
SUMMARY:  
source files, hits/tokens/total
  CMMALORY		2/1/1
whole search, hits/tokens/total
			2/1/1
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="ignore">
<h3>Ignoring nodes in searches</h3>

Certain node labels in the corpus indicate metalinguistic or other
information that should generally not be considered in searches.  For
instance, an intervening editorial comment, line break, page number, and
the like, should not affect searches involves immediate precedence.  It
is also often (though not always) desirable to ignore punctuation,
traces, other empty categories, and clitics.  Some of these items should
also generally be ignored when counting the number of words in a
constituent.  In deciding whether a given structure in the corpus
matches a query, CorpusSearch ignores nodes whose labels are on the
"<a href="#ignore_nodes">ignore_nodes</a>" list.  In connection with
<a href="search-functions.html#domsWords">domsWords</a> and its variants,
CorpusSearch uses the "<a href="#ignore_words">ignore_words</a>" list
instead.  Labels can be added to these lists using
"<a href="#add_to_ignore">add_to_ignore</a>" and
"<a href="#add_to_ignore_words">add_to_ignore_words</a>", respectively,
or they can be revised more extensively (including the option of not
ignoring any nodes or words), as discussed under the individual
commands.  Any of the commands mentioned in this paragraph can be
specified in individual command files or, as usual, more generally in
the <a href="pref.html">preferences file</a>.

<p>
The following table is intended as a convenient summary of the commands
in this section.  For more details, see the entries for the individual
commands.

<blockquote>

<p>
"ignore_nodes" tells CorpusSearch to ignore the specified nodes in
connection with all search functions except for
<a href="search-functions.html#domsWords">domsWords</a> and its
variants.  (For the latter, CorpusSearch uses the list specified
by <a href="command-file.html#ignore_words">ignore_words</a>.)  For
instance, running this query:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(NP* iPrecedes PP*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

returns the following sentence despite the CODE node intervening between
NP-1 and PP.  This is because the label "CODE" is on the default
"ignore_nodes" list.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
1 IP-MAT-SPE: 5 NP-1, 9 PP
*/
/~*
There ar two bretheren beyond the see,
(CMMALORY,15.439)

                 (22 E_S ,))
   (24 ID CMMALORY,15.439))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can replace the default list with a list of your own choosing, and
you can also tell CorpusSearch not to ignore any nodes with this
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
ignore_nodes:  null
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>If your query makes reference to an item on your "ignore_nodes"
    list, CorpusSearch will not issue a warning.  The only indication
    you will get of the incoherent character of your query is the
    unexpected and puzzling absence of hits in the output, as
    illustrated in what follows.
</table>

<p>
Here is an example of such an incoherent query:

<blockquote>
<pre>

ignore_nodes: NP*

query:  (NP* iDoms PRO*)

Running the query on the following input:

		             (23 NP (24 N mesure)))))
    (26 ID CMMALORY,2.13))
</pre>
</blockquote>

finds no hits, since CorpusSearch is literally following your
instruction to ignore all NP* nodes.  This includes the NP* nodes with
node addresses 4 and 9, which would otherwise match the query.

<blockquote>

<a name="add_to_ignore">
<h4>add_to_ignore: {list_of_labels}</h4>

<b>Default:</b> "" (empty string)

<p>
"add_to_ignore" add nodes to the "ignore_nodes" list.  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
add_to_ignore: INTJ*              &larr; "add_to_ignore", not "add_to_ignore_nodes"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="ignore_words">

</table>

<p>
"ignore_words" tells CorpusSearch what nodes to ignore when counting
words in connection
with <a href="search-functions.html#domsWords">domsWords</a> and its
variants.  (For all other search functions, CorpusSearch uses the list
specified in <a href="#ignore_nodes">ignore_nodes</a>.)  The default
list for "ignore_words" is the same list as for "ignore_nodes", except
that it also includes "0" and traces and empty categories (expressions
beginning with asterisk).  Nodes on the "ignore_words" list can be
terminals or preterminals (in other words, either elements of the text
itself or the associated POS tag).

<p>
As with the <a href="#ignore_nodes">ignore_nodes</a> list, you can edit
the "ignore_words" list, replacing the default list with a list of your
own or with the value "null" (if you want to count all terminal nodes in
the text, without ignoring any).

<a name="add_to_ignore_words">
<h4>add_to_ignore_words: {list_of_labels} </h4>

<b>Default:</b> "" (empty string)

<p>
"add_to_ignore_words" add nodes to the "ignore_words" list.  For
instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
add_to_ignore_words: [oO]h
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="print">
<h3>Output format commands</h3>

Output format commands control how search results are printed to the
output file.  They do not influence the results of a current search.
However, because they can cause the output of the current search to
include certain nodes or not, they may influence the contents of
searches that depend on the output of to the current one.

<p>
The following table is intended as a convenient summary of the commands
in this section.  For more details, see the entries for the individual
commands.

<blockquote>
<table border cellpadding=5>

</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="remark">
<h4>begin_remark: {remark string} end_remark</h4>

<b>Default:</b> "" (empty string)

<p>
This two-part command tells CorpusSearch to print a remark in the
preface to the output; for instance, a note about the purpose of a
particular search.  The following command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
begin_remark: 
pronoun objects
end_remark
</pre>
</blockquote>

would give rise to an output preface as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>

<a name="nodes_only">
<h4>nodes_only: (Boolean true or false) </h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="hand.GIF">
<td>When the output of some initial search that
    sets <a href="#nodes_only">nodes_only</a> to "true" becomes the

    by (though not necessarily identical with) the <a href="#node">node
    boundary</a> of the initial search.
</table>

<p>
If "nodes_only" is set to true, CorpusSearch prints out only
the <a href="#node">nodes</a> that match the query.  If it is set to
false, CorpusSearch prints out the entire sentence token containing the
structure matching the query.  For instance, with the default value of
"false", the following query:

<blockquote>
<pre>

nodes_only: f

query:  (ADVP* iDoms ADVP*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

gives the following output:

<blockquote>

<p>
CorpusSearch ordinarily outputs only nodes or tokens that match the
search specification.  Setting "print_complement" to "true" causes
CorpusSearch to print the matching tokens to the regular output file
(with the extension <b>.out</b>) and also all the tokens that don't
match to a separate complement file (with the extension <b>.cmp</b>).
In other words, "print_complement" applies logical NOT to an entire
query.

<p>
For instance, the following query could be used on an input file
containing all IPs with objects in order to divide those IPs into two
complementary sets: those with two objects (in the .out file) and those
with only one (in the .cmp file).

<blockquote>
<pre>
print_complement: t

node: IP*

query:    (IP* iDoms [1]NP-OB*)
      AND (IP* iDoms [2]NP-OB*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here is an example from the regular output file.  It matches the query
and has two objects:

<td>In general, "print_complement" should only be used on the output of
a previous search that has yielded some set that it is sensible to
divide into two complementary subsets.  Using a query with
"print_complement" on an entire corpus will generally result in a .cmp
file consisting of a grab bag of tokens without any theoretical significance.
</table>

<a name="print_indices">
<h4>print_indices: (Boolean true or false)</h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
"print_indices" tells CorpusSearch whether to print indices (node
addresses) in the output.  Node adress indices should not be confused
with <a href="query-language.html#prefix-indices">prefix indices</a>
(though prefix indices use addresses to fix the reference of search
arguments).  Node address indices start at 0
for <a href="#metaroot">$METAROOT</a> and systematically label every
node in the tree, including the word (terminal nodes).  By convention,
addresses for terminals are not printed even when "print_indices" is set
to "true".

<p>
Here's a piece of output structure with and without indices:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(10 NP-OB1 (11 NPR Morgan)     &larr; indices 12 "Morgan", 14 "le", 16 "Fay" omitted by convention
           (13 NPR le)
           (15 NPR Fay))

(NP-OB1 (NPR Morgan)
        (NPR le)
        (NPR Fey))
</pre>
</blockquote>

Output including index queries can be a bit cumbersome to read, but when
trouble-shooting a query that isn't having the intended effect, indices
in the tree structures are invaluable pointers for understanding what
CorpusSearch is matching and where the query needs to be revised.  This
is also true more generally in connection with complex queries or with
corpora with very long sentence tokens.

<a name="remove_nodes">
<h4>remove_nodes: (Boolean true or false)</h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
"remove_nodes" removes subtrees rooted in the same syntactic category as
the node boundary when the subtrees are themselves dominated by an
instance of that category (see below for details as to what counts as
the "same").  The removed subtree is replace by a label indicating the
material that has been removed.  If the removed subtree itself matches
the query, it will appear in its complete form as a separate output
token later in the output file.

<p>
CorpusSearch determines the syntactic category of the nodes to be removed
according to the following algorithm:

<p>
<ul>
<li>If the node boundary label contains any hyphens, the node's
    syntactic category is the substring of the label up to the leftmost
    hyphen, followed by an asterisk.
<li>If the node boundary label does not contain a hyphen, but does
    contain a trailing asterisk, the label is used as is.  
<li>If the node boundary label contains neither a hyphen nor a trailing
    asterisk, an asterisk is appended to the label.
</ul>

<p>
For instance, all of the following node boundaries - IP-MAT-PRN*, IP*,
IP - yield IP* as the syntactic category to be removed.

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="caution.GIF">
<td>All NP node boundaries yield NP* as the node to be removed.  This
will match the POS tag NPR and its variants and possibly lead to
unintended matches.
</table>

<p>
In the following command file, "remove_nodes" is set to "true":

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*

remove_nodes: true

query: (NP-OB* iDoms PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This yields output of the following type:

<blockquote>
<pre>

</blockquote>

The structure of the parenthetical IP "seyde the knyght" is removed from
the output and replaced with the label "RMV:{rmv_string}", where
"rmv_string" stands for the concatenation of (up to) the first three
words (terminal nodes) of the removed material.

<p>
Further searches on the output file above will be able to search only
IP* nodes with pronoun objects.  If "nodes_only" were set to "false",
this restriction would not hold.

<a name="ur_text_only">
<h4>ur_text_only: (Boolean true or false)</h4>

<b>Default:</b> false

<p>
"ur_text" refers to the text in its unannotated form.  "ur_text_only"
prints only the ur_text of the tokens matching the query, suppressing
printing of the labeled bracketing and associated information.

<a name="command-spec">
<a name="query">

<h3>Command specification</h3>

Every command file must contain a command specification, which instructs
CorpusSearch as to what action to carry out on the input.  The command
specification for ordinary queries is:

<blockquote>
</pre>
query: { condition(s) }
</pre>
</blockquote>

The conditions contain one or
more <a href="search-functions.html">search functions</a> in accordance
with the syntax of the CorpusSearch <a href="query-language.html">query
language.</a>

<a name="reformat">
<h4>reformat_corpus</h4>

A command file consisting of only the following command specification
(without a preamble):

<blockquote>
<pre>
reformat_corpus: t
</pre>
</blockquote>

normalizes the format of an input file.  "reformat_corpus" can be
thought of as applying a vacuous query to a file.  The result is an
output file in the same format as would result from an ordinary query.
In the name of the output file, the extension <b>.fmt</b> is appended to
the entire name of the input file (including any extensions).

<p>
"reformat_corpus" is useful for following up with Unix "diff" when
comparing two versions of the same file or corpus - say, before and
after running a <a href="revision.html">corpus revision query</a>.

<a name="comments">
<h3>Comments</h3>

Comments may appear anywhere in a command file.  They are also allowed
anywhere in the input file(s).

<p>
By default, single-line comments are introduced by "//", and multi-line
comments (block comments) appear between "/*" and "*/".  These comment
delimiters can be changed for input files, <u>but not for command files.</u>

<p>
The command "corpus_line_comment" changes the line comment delimiter.
For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
corpus_line_comment: \\
</pre>
</blockquote>

The paired commands "corpus_comment_begin" and "corpus_comment_end" change
the block comment delimiters.  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
corpus_comment_begin: <+
corpus_comment_end: +>
</pre>
</blockquote>

The default values for the delimiters can be changed in the preamble 
of an individual command file or, as usual, more generally in the
<a href="pref.html">preferences file</a>.
