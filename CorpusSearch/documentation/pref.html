<h3>What do preference files do?</h3>

CorpusSearch sets its own default values for certain variables and
commands (as described in the users guide for the items in question).
In some cases, you might prefer to use a non-default value, and
preference files allow you to do that.  In other words, the values you
specify in a preference file override the CorpusSearch default values.
In turn, any values you specify in a query file override those in a
preference file.

<p>
For instance, CorpusSearch sets the line comment delimiter to "//", your
preference file might set it to "/!/", and you might run a query file
that sets it to "/>".  It is the last value that CorpusSearch uses when
running the query file in question.  When running another query file
that doesn't explicitly set the line comment delimiter, the value that
CorpusSearch would use in that case is the one in your preference file.

<p>
You do not need a preference file to run CorpusSearch.  But if a
preference file does exist in the same directory as the query file you
are running, CorpusSearch will automatically read the preference file.

<a name="content">
<h3>Content of preference files</h3>

The content of preference files consists of various CorpusSearch
commands along with the values that you wish to associate with them,
including a default <a href="def.html">definition file</a>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
// a preference file for the Korean corpus
corpus_comment_begin: <
corpus_comment_end: >
corpus_line_comment: ;;
define: korean.def
node: S
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> Preference files have the extension <b>.prf</b> and must be stored
in the same directory as the query file.

<a name="output">
<h3>Reference to preference files in output files</h3>

<p>
The output from a search that calls a preference file will include a
line in the preface like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
preference file:  korean.prf
</pre>
</blockquote>

This is what the line would look like in context.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
PREFACE:
CorpusSearch copyright Beth Randall 2000.
Date:  Mon Feb 26 09:28:55 EST 2001

command file:     search.q
preference file:  korean.prf

input file:       file001.psd
output file:      file001.psd.out

query:  ([1]NNC iPrecedes [2]NNC)
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

If you intended to use a preference file, but you don't see a
"preference file" line in your output file, check that the following
requirements are met:

<ul>
<li>The preference file must be stored in the same directory as the query file.
<li>The name of the preference file must end in ".prf" (rather than,
say, "pref").
</ul>
