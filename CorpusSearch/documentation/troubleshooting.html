This section gives tips on troubleshooting a number of common problems
and errors that arise when using CorpusSearch.  The reader is assumed to
have a general familiarity with the rest of the CorpusSearch manual.  In
some of the example queries, we make reference to definitions from the
following definition file:

<blockquote>
<pre>
finite_verb:  BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|VB[DP]|MD
non_finite_verb:  *VB|V*N|*HV|H*N|*DO|D*N|*BE|BEN
non-pronominal_NP: *N*|D*|Q*|ADJ*|CONJ*|*ONE*|*OTHER*|CP*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="adjacent-pipe-symbols">
<h3>Adjacent pipe symbols</h3>

Adjacent pipe symbols (<tt>||</tt>) in a query will crash CorpusSearch.
The adjacent pipe symbols may be in a definition file called by the
query, rather than in the query itself.

<a name="confusing-precedence-and-sisterhood">
<h3>Confusing (immediate) precedence and sisterhood</h3>

As mentioned in the entries
for <a href="search-functions.html#precedes">precedes</a> and
<a href="search-functions.html#iPrecedes">iPrecedes</a> on the one hand
and <a href="search-functions.html#hasSister">hasSister</a> on the
other, (immediate) precedence does not imply sisterhood, or vice versa.
See the entries for the commands for examples.  The two relations must
be specified separately.

<a name="escaped-vs-bare-asterisks">
<h3>"Escaped" vs. bare asterisks</h3>

In connection with searching for expressions enclosed in asterisks like
traces and empty categories, it is necessary to carefully distinguish
between <tt>\*</tt> and <tt>*</tt>.  The first expression (the "escaped"
asterisk) matches an asterisk character in the input, whereas the second
expression matches any string (including the null string).

<p>

<h3>Ill-formed input</h3>

<a name="redirecting-error-output">
<h4>Preliminary: Redirecting error output</h4>

When CorpusSearch encounters ill-formed input, it stops writing to the
output file and starts writing to standard output instead, which is the
terminal screen by default.  When debugging, particularly in connection
with <a href="#mismatched-parens">mismatched parens</a>, it is generally
necessary to redirect the output to a named error file (say, ERR) by a
command along the following lines.

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS query.q file.psd >& ERR
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If desired, such a command can be backgrounded in the usual way with a
trailing ampersand.

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS query.q file.psd >& ERR &
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="mismatched-parens">
<p>
<h4>Mismatched parens</h4> 

The most seriously ill-formed input involves mismatched parens, which
generally arise from editing a parsed file with an ordinary text editor
like emacs rather than with Annotald or a similar program.

<ul>
<li>When CorpusSearch encounters an unexpected mismatched right paren,
it crashes, reporting details of the location.  These mismatched paren
errors are easy to fix.  In the converse case of a missing right paren,
however, CorpusSearch will unfortunately not break at the next wrapper
paren.  Rather, it gobbles up the rest of the file.  In the case of a
large file (as when correcting an entire corpus in a single text file),
if you are piping to ERR, the ERR file can become humongous to the point
of filling up your entire disk, leading to quite scary system error
messages.  If this happens, kill the CS job, /bin/rm the ERR file, and
locate the mismatched paren as described below.

<p>
<li>
In order to find mismatched parens, use the emacs command
<tt>forward-sexp</tt>, which starts from some left paren and jumps to
the corresponding right paren.  You can invoke the command on the mode
line with <tt>M-x forward-sexp</tt>, or you can bind the command to
something like <tt>C-x C-f</tt> in your .emacs file.  In what follows,
we assume the latter.

<p>
<li>You can repeat <tt>forward-sexp</tt> arbitrarily many times by
prefacing it with <tt>C-u NUM</tt>, where <tt>NUM</tt> is the desired
number of repetitions.

<blockquote>
<pre>
C-u 400 C-x C-f
</pre>
</blockquote>

A command like the one just above will either go to completion or result
in an error message.  If the latter, you know that the mismatched paren
is somewhere between where you started the command and the expected end.

<p>
<li>Continued use of <tt>C-x C-f</tt> will allow you to zero in on the
mismatched parens that are the problem.  Patience is the key.

<p>
<li>CorpusSearch sometimes erroneously reports mismatched parens in
connection with certain characters, notably <tt>\"</tt> (double quote).
<!--To further aggravate matters, <tt>forward-sexp</tt> works
differently in ordinary emacs and in parser-mode emacs in these cases,
treating the offending character on a par with an open paren in the one
case, but not the other.--> A workaround is to replace the offending
character, at least temporarily, by some innocous character sequence
like <tt>&lt;double-quote&gt;</tt>.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="missing-wrapper-parens">
<h4>Missing wrapper parens</h4>

Wrapper parens are the unlabelled parens that delimit each token in Penn
Treebank format, as highlighted in red in (1a).  If the wrapper parens
are missing, the token looks like (1b), and you will have to add the
relevant parens.

<blockquote>
<pre>
(1) a.  <font color="red">(</font> (IP-MAT ...
        )<font color="red">)</font>

    b.  (IP-MAT ...
        )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="other">
<h4>Other ill-formed input sequences</h4>

CorpusSearch helpfully breaks on various other ill-formed input
sequences like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(2) a.  ( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO$ My) (N neighbor))
                  (VBD told)
                  <font color="red">me</font>					&larr; bare word (missing preterminal over terminal)
          (. .)))

    b.  ( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ (PRO$ My) (N neighbor))
                  (VBD told)
                  (NP-OB2 (PRO <font color="red">m e</font>))			&larr; terminal contains space
          (. .)))

    c.  ( (IP-MAT (NP-SBJ <font color="red">(PRO$ My</font>			&larr; preterminal isn't unary-branching
                                <font color="red">(N neighbor))</font>)
                    
                  (VBD told)
                  (NP-OB2 (PRO me)))
          (. .))
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<a name="missing-asterisk">
<h3>Missing asterisk</h3>

In general, it is wise to be liberal with asterisks and to omit them
only if you are sure that you <u>don't</u> need them.  For instance,
<tt>NP-SBJ</tt> as a search term finds only a subset of subjects.  It
does not match subjects that are resumptive (<tt>NP-SBJ-RSP</tt>),
coindexed with a clause (<tt>NP-SBJ-1</tt>), or with any other
additional material after the dash tag.  Using <tt>NP-SBJ*</tt> will
find all subjects, no matter what might be added on to the end of the
label.

<p>
When you want to refer to all the variants of a label except for one or
two, you have to explicitly list all the desired variants.  For
instance, if you are interested in all instances of <tt>ADVP*</tt>
except for <tt>ADVP-DIR</tt>, you must use a disjunction like the
following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
ADVP|ADVP-LOC|ADVP-TMP
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In such cases, best practice is to include the disjunction in a
<a href="def.html">definition file</a>.

<a name="missing-define">
<h3>Missing <tt>define</tt></h3>

A common error is to intend to use a definition file, but to omit the
requisite <tt>define</tt> command in
the <a href="command-file.html#preamble">preamble</a>.  CorpusSearch
issues no warning message, but the search will not yield the intended
output because CorpusSearch interprets the strings intended as
definitions as literal strings, which generally do not match anything in
the input.

<a name="missing-prefix-indices">
<h3>Missing prefix indices</h3>

Probably the most common error is to forget to add prefix indices to
arguments of a search function.  This is the chief cause of a baffling
absence of hits.  Here is an example of a query intended to find clauses
in which both the subject and the object are prounous.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (NP-SBJ* iDoms PRO)
      AND (NP-OB1* iDoms PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This query can never return any hits, because the two instances of PRO
are interpreted by default as referring to the same node.  But that
configuration is not a possible tree structure, as one and the same node
cannot be simultaneously dominated by the subject and the object.  The
two instances of PRO must be distinguished with distinct prefix indices:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (NP-SBJ* iDoms [1]PRO)
      AND (NP-OB1* iDoms [2]PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="missing-same-instance">
<h3>Missing same-instance</h3>

Errors due by <a href="#missing-prefix-indices">missing prefix
indices</a> can be thought of as unintentionally overusing
same-instance.  Same-instance can also be underused.  Consider the
following query, intended to retrieve instances of V2 with
clause-initial adverb phrases.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (IP* iDomsFirst ADVP*)
      AND (finite_verb iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The intended instances will be retrieved, but so will unintended tokens
like the following, where the finite verb and the subject are not
clausemates of the adverb phrase, as clearly indicated by the node
indices in the <a href="understanding-output.html#output">result
block</a>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
1 IP-MAT:  1 IP-MAT, 2 ADVP-TMP, 16 BEP, 18 NP-SBJ
*/
(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 ADVP-TMP (3 ADV Yesterday))
	      (5 NP-SBJ (6 PRO they))
	      (8 VBD asked)
	      (10 , ,)
	      (12 " ")
	      (14 CP-QUE-MAT-SPE (15 IP-SUB-SPE (16 BEP Are)
						(18 NP-SBJ (19 PRO you))
						(21 VAG coming)
						(23 PP (24 P with)
						       (26 NP (27 PRO us)))))
	      (29 . ?)
	      (31 " ")))
</pre>
</blockquote>

The reason for this error is that the query fails to impose the
clausemate condition.  The solution is to "tie" the constituents in the
second clause of the query to one or more constituents in the first
clause of the query by exploiting same-instance.  Here is one way of
doing that:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (IP* iDomsFirst ADVP*)
      AND (IP* iDomsNumber 2 finite_verb)
      AND (IP* iDomsNumber 3 NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is another way:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:    (IP* iDomsFirst ADVP*)
      AND (ADVP* hasSister finite_verb)
      AND (finite_verb hasSister NP-SBJ*)
      AND (ADVP* iPrecedes finite_verb)
      AND (finite_verb iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="redundant-exists">
<h3>Redundant <tt>exists</tt></h3>

<p>
The following query is not ill-formed, but it is inefficient.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:     (NP-SBJ* exists) 
       AND (ADJ exists)
       AND (NP-SBJ* iDoms ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The final clause in the query implies the two preceding ones, and the
same effect can therefore be obtained more simply with:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:     (NP-SBJ* iDoms ADJ)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="stalled-search">
<h3>Stalled search</h3>

Before running a CorpusSearch job in the background, make sure there is
no .out file corresponding to the query you intend to run.  CorpusSearch
ordinarily warns you that it is about to overwrite the existing .out
file and prompts you to allow the search to go forward.  But if you
background the job, the prompt is backgrounded too and you never get a
chance to permit the search.  As a result, the command stalls and will
have to be killed.

<p>
The above scenario is a common cause of searches that take an
unexpectedly long time.  (This can be confirmed with Unix/Linux's 
<tt>jobs</tt> command.)
