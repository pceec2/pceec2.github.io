<h3>What is CorpusSearch?</h3>

The basic purpose of CorpusSearch is to find linguistic structures in a
corpus of parsed sentences.   It also has several other features, including
support for:

<ul>
<li>automatic creation of coding strings for statistical analysis
<li>automatic corpus revision
<li>automatic creation of a lexicon for a corpus
<li>automatic creation of local "frames" for words in a corpus
</ul>

<a name="input">
<h3>Input to CorpusSearch</h3>

CorpusSearch needs two pieces of information: 

<ul>
<li>a corpus of sentences to search - source file(s)
<li>a specification of what structures to search for - command file
</ul>

<a name="source">
<h4>Source file(s)</h4>

A source file is any file of parsed sentences that satisfies
CorpusSearch's <a href="compatibility.html">compatibility
requirements</a>.  This could be a file from the Penn Parsed Corpora of
Historical English or from another parsed corpus, or perhaps a file of
sentences that the user has cut and pasted together.

<p> CorpusSearch allows output files from previous searches to serve as
source files for subsequent searches.

<p> Any number of source files can be searched in a single run.

<a name="command">
<h4>Command file</h4>

The <a href="command-file.html">command file</a> minimally contains
a <a href="query-language.html">query</a>, which specifies the
structures being searched for, and a
<a href="command-file.html#node">boundary node</a>, which specifies the
syntactic domain within which the search is to take place.  Beyond that,
the command file can also include further specifications, mainly
concerning the format of the output.

<a name="output">
<h3>Output of CorpusSearch</h3>

<a name="ordinary">
<h4>Ordinary search output</h4>

An ordinary <a href="understanding-output.html">output file</a> contains
the sentences that match the specifications in the search query, along
with information pinpointing where the structures were found (this is
useful in the case of very long sentences).  Statistics are kept
detailing the number of structures matching the search query ("hits"),
the number of sentence tokens ("tokens") containing hits, and the total
number of tokens in the file.  

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="hand.GIF">
<td>The number of hits may change depending on the definition of
the <a href="command-file.html#node">boundary node</a>.
</table>

<a name="coding">
<h4>Coding output</h4>

CorpusSearch can add <a href="coding.html">coding strings</a> to a
corpus that are suitable as input to multivariate statistical analysis.
Each coding string consists of columns associated with various
properties of interest to the researcher, and the values for the columns
are generated automatically according to specifications in the coding
query.

<p>
For instance, the value in the first column of a coding string might
encode the syntactic category of a sentence's first constituent.  The
second and third columns might encode the same information for the
sentence's second and third constituents, respectively.  The information
from all three columns could then be used to calculate the frequency of
basic word order patterns in the corpus ("SVO", "SOV", etc.).  (In
principle, the same statistics could also be obtained from the output 
of multiple ordinary search queries, but that process would be much more
laborious and prone to human error.)

<a name="revision">
<h4>Corpus revision output</h4>

CorpusSearch can produce a copy of a corpus in which certain structures
are automatically revised according to user specifications.  This
feature greatly speeds up corpus construction and facilitates corpus
curation.  In particular, corpus revision can be used to:

<ul>
<li>apply global changes in annotation guidelines to an entire corpus
<li>automatically correct systematic annotation errors, or flag possible
    errors for human review
<li>build parsed corpora from POS-tagged corpora from scratch
    (for instance, in situations where no parsed training data exist)
</ul>

<a name="frames">
<h4>Frames output</h4>

CorpusSearch can generate the set of <a href="frames.html">local
frames</a> for given words.  These frames are defined as the syntactic
sisters of the part-of-speech label of the word in question.  This might
be helpful in constructing word classes - for instance, in comparing the
distribution of double-object verbs (<i>John gave Mary a present</i>)
and double-complement verbs (<i>John gave a present to Mary</i>).

<a name="lexicon">
<h4>Lexicon output</h4>

CorpusSearch can generate a <a href="lexicon.html">lexicon</a> for a
corpus.  The output is a list of every word in the corpus along with the
number of times it occurs under each part-of-speech label that it can
have.
