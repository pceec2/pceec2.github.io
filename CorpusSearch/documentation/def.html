<h3>What do definition files do?</h3>

From a purely technical point of view, definition files are an optional
convenience for the CorpusSearch user.  But in connection with using
CorpusSearch in the context of real-life research projects, it is best
to think of definition files as a resource that should be exploited
whenever possible.

<p>
In the course of doing research on, say, the verbal syntax of English
you might find yourself making reference to finite verbs over and over
again.  You might start out with a disjunction like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then you realize that given the complexity of the annotation system
you're using, you need to include versions of the items above with
prefixed negative clitics or other material.

<blockquote>
<pre>
*+BE[DP]|*+DO[DP]|*+HV[DP]|*+MD|*+VB[DP]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
So now your list of search terms includes both the simple and the
prefixed variants.

<blockquote>
<pre>
BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP]|*+BE[DP]|*+DO[DP]|*+HV[DP]|*+MD|*+VB[DP]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="question">
<p>
The items on the list have to be separated by a single pipe symbol
("|"))to be interpreted correctly.  Two adjacent pipe symbols will cause
CorpusSearch to crash, but the inadvertent absence of a pipe symbol is
more problematic in that CorpusSearch will run, but just not give you
the correct results.  For instance, the following disjunction will fail
to find any instances of simple finite BE or finite
DO.  <a href="#answer">Can you see why?</a>

<blockquote>
<pre>
BE[DP]DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP]|*+BE[DP]|*+DO[DP]|*+HV[DP]|*+MD|*+VB[DP]
</pre>
</blockquote>

If you have several queries that are intended to refer to the same
search term, it can become a job in itself to ensure that those terms
are defined consistently across all your queries.  Wouldn't it be nice
if there were a single place to define all your search terms, so that
when you make revisions, they affect all queries making reference to
those terms in a uniform way?

<p>
There is such a place.  It's called a definition file.

<a name="content">
<h3>Content of definition files</h3>

<p>
A definition file is simply a file containing the various labels that
you want to group together, together with a string (the "definition")
that allows you to make reference to them.  Here's an example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
// definitions for Middle English

finite_verb:    BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP]|*+BE[DP]|*+DO[DP]|*+HV[DP]|*+MD|*+VB[DP]

nonfinite_verb: BE|DO|HV|MD0|VB|*+BE|*+DO|*+HV|*+MD0|*+VB
</pre>
</blockquote>

The definition on the left must be an orthographic word (that is, not contain
spaces).  It is followed by a colon, and then the list of labels that it abbreviates.

<p>
Each label must be associated with a unique list.  So the following
definition file is not good, because the expression "finite_verb" is
ambiguous:

<blockquote>
<pre>
finite_verb:  BE[DP]
finite_verb:  VB[DP]
</pre>
</blockquote>

However, the lists on the right can be associated with more than one
definition, and this can be useful, as is discussed further in the
section on <a href="#recursive">Recursive definitions</a>.

<a name="calling">
<h3>Calling definition files in command files</h3>

Definition files must have the extension <b>.def</b>, and they must be
stored in the same directory as the command file.
Unlike <a href="pref.html">preference files</a>, definition files must
be explicitly included in the command file with a line like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
define: ppche.def
</pre>
</blockquote>

(The reason CorpusSearch treat definition files differently from
preference files is that it is usual for users to have more than one
definition file (say, for various languages, as
discussed <a href="#some-reasons">later on</a>).  By contrast, users'
preferences tend to be stable and so only one preference file is needed.)

<p>
An entire query might then read as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP*

define: ppche.def

query:  (finite_verb precedes nonfinite_verb)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The line beginning with "define" instructs CorpusSearch where to find
the definitions for "finite_verb" and "nonfinite_verb".  Without this
line, "finite_verb" and "nonfinite_verb" will be read as literal strings
and not be replaced by their definitions.  Most likely, this would result
in CorpusSearch reporting no hits for the search (since most parsed
corpora will not contain instances of the literal strings "finite_verb"
or "nonfinite_verb").

<p>
If a particular search reports no hits or suspiciously low numbers of
hits for a particular search term, this is likely due to:
<ul>
<li>a failure to include a "define" line in the query line (as just mentioned)
<li>a missing pipe symbol between search terms in the definition file
    (as in the "Can you see why?" example)
<li>a discrepancy between the expression in your definition file and in
    your query (for instance, the definition file has "finite_verb" with
    underscore, but the command file has "finite-verb" with hyphen or
    "finiteVerb" with camel case)
</ul>

<a name="output">
<h3>Reference to definition files in output files</h3>

The output from a search that calls a definition file will include a
preface along the following lines:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
    PREFACE:
    CorpusSearch copyright Beth Randall 2000.
    Date:  Thu Apr 13 08:57:07 EDT 2000

    command file:       search.q
    output file:        search.out

    definition file:  ppche.def
    node:   IP*
    query:  (BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP]|*+BE[DP]|*+DO[DP]|*+HV[DP]|*+MD|*+VB[DP] precedes BE|DO|HV|MD0|VB|*+BE|*+DO|*+HV|*+MD0|*+VB)
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

The entry under "definition file" gives the name of the definition file
that CorpusSearch used when running the query in search.q.  Since you
might have made changes to the file between running the query and
reviewing the output of the search, CorpusSearch also reports the actual
query that it ran.  This can be helpful in troubleshooting.  Here are
some common reasons for errors:

<ul>
<li>You've forgotten the "define" line in the command file.  In this
    case, the preface should not contain an entry for "definition file",
    and the expression after "query" should contain unexpanded labels.
<li>You've referenced some irrelevant definition file in the command
    file.
<li>There's some discrepancy between the labels that you used in the
    query file and the ones in the definition file.  For instance, you
    might have used labels in the query file that don't exist in the
    definition file, or you've misspelled a label in the query file, or
    used a hyphen for an underscore (or vice versa), and the like.
</ul>

<a name="recursive">
<h3>Recursive definitions</h3>

Definitions may be recursive, allowing complex definitions to be built
up out of more basic ones.  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
finite_verb_1:   BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP]
finite_verb_2:   *+BE[DP]|*+DO[DP]|*+HV[DP]|*+MD|*+VB[DP]
finite_verb:     $finite_verb_1|$finite_verb_2
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you can never remember whether you refer to finite verbs in your
queries as "finite_verb" or "Vfin", you can use recursive definitions to
render the question irrelevant by including lines like the following
(best right after the non-recursive, basic definition, as shown here):

<blockquote>
<pre>
finite_verb:          $finite_verb_1|$finite_verb_2
Vfin:                 $finite_verb
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="some-reasons">
<h3>Some reasons to use definition files</h3>

As we mentioned at the outset, definition files are an extremely useful
tool, powerful and flexible at once, and we urge CorpusSearch users to
use them whenever the search terms in their queries becomes even the
slightest bit complex.

<p>
As we mentioned, they offer a powerful assist in enforcing consistency
across queries of all sorts (whether ordinary, revision, or coding
queries).  Any revisions that you make to your search terms are made
only once - in the definition file.

<p>
Definition files can greatly facilitate comparative searches across
corpora from various languages or linguistic stages that use different
annotation labels for the same (or very similar) linguistic concepts.
For instance, in conducting research on Old English and later stages of
English using the York corpora of Old English and the Penn Historical
Corpora, one could set up distinct definition files because of the
divergent annotation guidelines, but use query files that are identical
in every respect but than the "define" line.

<blockquote>
<pre>
// old-english.def

subj:        NP-NOM*
dir-obj:     NP-ACC*
indir-obj:   NP-DTV*
finite_be:   BE[DP]|BE[DP][IS]|BEPH

<hr>
// later-english.def

subj:        NP-SBJ*
dir-obj:     NP-OB1*
indir-obj:   NP-OB2*
finite_be:   BE[DP]

<hr>
// sample-search-old-english.q

node: IP*

define: oe.def

query:     (subj hasSister finite_be)
       AND (subj iPrecedes finite_be)

<hr>
// sample-search-later-english.q

same as previous except for the "define" line, which would read "define: later-english.def".
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Definition files can be used as a "poor man's lemmatizer" and "poor
man's verb classifier" along the following lines.  (The entries are very
simplified; there are many more spelling variants to be considered in
historical texts.)

<blockquote>
<pre>
give:  [gG][eiy][uv]e
gave:  [gG]ave
given: [gG][eiy][uv]en
send:  [sS]end|[sS]ende
sent:  [sS]ent|[sS]ente
GIVE:  $give|$gave|$given
SEND:  $send|$sent
double-object-verb: $GIVE|$SEND
</pre>
</blockquote>

In conjunction with <a href="revision.html">corpus revision queries</a>,
these entries could be used to associate lemmas with verb forms.  The
following revision query gives outputs in the style of IcePAHC.

<blockquote>
<pre>
query: (V* iDoms {1}GIVE)

append_label{1}: =give
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<hr>

<a name="answer">
<p>
<a href="#question">Answer to question</a>: There's a pipe symbol
missing after BE[DP].  Unlike in the correct query with the pipe symbol,
the query with the error instructs CorpusSearch to search for the
expression "BE[DP]DO[DP]", which expands to BEDDOD, BEPDOD, BEPDOD, and
BEPDOP.  None of these labels exist in the corpus.
