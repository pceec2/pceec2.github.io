<h3>General form of the output</h3>

By default, the name of an output file is the same as the input file,
but with the (additional) extension <b>.out</b>.

<p>
Output files have the following general form:

<ul>
<li>Each output file contains a <a href="#preface">preface</a> and
    a <a href="#summary">summary</a>.
<li>For each input file reported in the output file, there is
    a <a href="#header">header</a> and a <a href="#footer">footer</a>.
<li>Each sentence token in the input file that matches the query is
    associated with the <a href="#output">following information</a>:
    <ul>
    <li>the original text (or ur-text),
    <li>a result block specifying the nodes that match the query, and
    <li>the parsed structure itself.
    </ul>
</ul>

<a name="sample">
<h3>Sample output file</h3>

In what follows, we walk through a sample output file resulting from a
query that searches for inverted pronoun subjects - that is, pronoun
subjects that follow the tensed verb.  (The query is somewhat simplified
compared with what would be required for an actual search on Middle
English files.)

<a name="preface">
<h4>Preface</h4>

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
    PREFACE:
    CorpusSearch copyright Beth Randall 2004.
    Date:  Sun Apr 30 07:05:51 EDT 2004

    command file:       inversion.q
    output file:        inversion.out

    remark:   This query searches for inverted pronoun subjects.

    node:   IP*

    print_indices: true

    query:      (ADJP*|ADVP*|NP*|PP* iPrecedes BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP])
            AND (ADJP*|ADVP*|NP*|PP* iDoms !\*T*)
            AND (BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|MD|VB[DP] iPrecedes NP-SBJ*)
            AND (NP-SBJ* iDoms PRO)

*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

The preface begins with a copyright declaration and the date and time of
the search.

<p>
It then lists the names of the command file and output file.

<p>
The optional <a href="command-file.html#remark">remark</a> serves as a reminder
of the purpose of the query.

<p>
The preface then prints a copy of the query.  Any labels from a
definition file are expanded according to their definitions (this
prevents confusion resulting from any subsequent changes to the
definition file).  For instance, lines 1 and 3 of the above query might
have looked like this in the original command file:

<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
                (ADJP*|ADVP*|NP*|PP* iPrecedes finiteVerb)
            ...
            AND (finiteVerb iPrecedes NP-SBJ*
            ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="header">
<h4>Header</h4>

The header lists each source file with its name as it appears in the
corpus directory.  If the source file is itself the output of a
CorpusSearch run, the name appears as it appears in the ID nodes for
that file (in this case, CMCAPCHR).  In the absence of an ID node, the
filename is reported as NULL.  For more information on searching output
files, see <a href="#using">below</a>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
    HEADER:
    source file:  cmcapchr.m4.psd
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="output">
<h4>Output sentence</h4>

Each output sentence is divided into three parts:

<ul>
<li>the original text (also referred to as the ur-text)
<li>the result block, which specifies the nodes that match the query
<li>the sentence in its parsed form
</ul>

Here is a short example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
His fadir scheep kepte he ful mekly;
(CMCAPCHR,32.13)
*~/

/*
    1 IP-MAT: 2 NP-OB1, 7 VBD kepte, 6 NS scheep, 8 NP-SBJ, 9 PRO he
*/

(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 NP-OB1 (3 NP-POS (4 PRO$ His) (6 N$ fadir))
			(8 NS scheep))
	      (10 VBD kepte)
	      (12 NP-SBJ (13 PRO he))
	      (15 ADVP (16 ADVR ful) (18 ADV mekly))
	      (20 E_S ;))
    (22 ID CMCAPCHR,32.13))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The original text is surrounded by special markers, "/~*" and "*~/".  
If a subsequent search is run on the output file, CorpusSearch finds 
and records this block of data.  In this way, the original text of the
entire sentence is conserved across multiple searches (with possibly
different boundary nodes).

<p>
The result block is surrounded by special markers of its own, "/*" and
"*/".  The first item in the result block is the boundary node (in this
case, <nobr>1 IP-MAT),</nobr> which matches the value of the "node:"
line of the command file.  The boundary node is separated by a colon
from the rest of the list, which specifies the nodes in the structure
that match the nodes specified in the body of the query.

<p>
The numbers preceding the nodes in the result block are the indices on
the nodes of the labeled bracketing.  These indices are intended to
clarify how the token comes to match the query.  They are always present
in the result block.  They are explicitly included in the labeled
bracketing when the <a href="command-file.html#preamble">preamble</a>
includes the line "print_indices: true".
<!--The list of indices and structures is structured so that no node is reported 
more than once.-->

<p>
In cases where more than one node matches a single search-function
argument, the result block reports the first matching node.  But in the
case of negated arguments, the result block reports the last matching
node (since the logic of negation requires it to check every possible
match).  For instance, the argunent "!\*T*" in the second line of the
sample query matches both "3 NP-POS" and "8 NS" in the sample input, and
CorpusSearch reports the second node.

<p>
The parsed version of the output sentence is indented to show the
structure of the tree.  Sisters have the same indentation (for instance,
"2 NP-OB1" and "10 VBD").  Daughters are indented further than
their mothers.  If a node dominates only leaves, they are printed on the
same line to save space.

<a name="footer">
<h4>Footer</h4>

The footer gives the statistics for <a href="#hits">hits, tokens, and
total</a> as found in a particular input file.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
FOOTER
  source file, hits/tokens/total
cmcapchr.m4.psd     220/220/4175
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
This same information appears again as a line in the <a href="#summary">summary</a>.

<a name="hits">
<h4>Hits/tokens/total</h4>

CorpusSearch reports the following statistics:

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td>hits
<td>number of distinct boundary nodes contaning the searched-for structure
<tr>
<td>tokens
<td>number of parsed objects enclosed in wrapper parens in which hits occurred
<tr>
<td>total
<td>total number of independent parsed objects searched
</table>

<p>
When searching a corpus file, tokens tend to be matrix sentences, though
they can also be fragments of one sort or another.  Tokens can contain
several distinct boundary nodes.  For instance, a root IP-MAT might
contain several NP nodes, each of which counts as a boundary node in a
query with the value "NP*" for "node".  If more than one of these NPs
match the query, the single token in question contains more than one
hit.  It is thus possible (and indeed common) for the number of hits to
exceed the number of tokens.  Conversely, by definition, the number of
tokens cannot exceed the number of hits; it can only ever equal it.

<a name="summary">
<h4>Summary</h4>

The summary repeats the information in the footers for each individual
input file, but reported together in one place - at the end of the
output file.  The following sample summary was produced by a search on
all files in the Middle English corpus (PPCME2) from the fourth time
period (1420-1500), indicated by the "m4" in the filename.

<blockquote>

<a name="using">
<h3>Using nodes_only and remove_nodes</h3>

Consider the following query (2vb.q), which searches for matrix clauses
containing a subject that precedes at least two verbs (including
modals).  We begin with a version of this query that sets "nodes_only"
to "f"; "remove_nodes" is then necessarily set to "f" as well.  Later
on, we discuss the effect of setting these commands to "t".

<blockquote>
<pre>
nodes_only: f

// the following command is commented out since it is redundant
// remove_nodes: f

node:  IP-MAT*

query:     (IP-MAT* iDoms NP-SBJ*)
       AND (NP-SBJ* hasSister BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|VB[DP]|MD)
       AND (NP-SBJ* precedes BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|VB[DP]|MD)
       AND (NP-SBJ* hasSister BE|BEN|DO|D[AO]N|HV|H[AV]N|VB|VA[GN])
       AND (NP-SBJ* precedes BE|BEN|DO|D[AO]N|HV|H[AV]N|VB|VA[GN])
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is a sample sentence that matches the query.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
They would have told you if you had visited them.
*~/
/*
1 IP-MAT:  1 IP-MAT, 2 NP-SBJ, 5 MD, 7 HV
*/
(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 NP-SBJ (3 PRO They))
	      (5 MD would)
	      (7 HV have)
	      (9 VBN told)
	      (11 NP-OB2 (12 PRO you))
	      (14 PP (15 P if)
		     (17 CP-ADV (18 C 0)
				(20 IP-SUB (21 NP-SBJ (22 PRO you))
					   (24 HVD had)
					   (26 VBN visited)
					   (28 NP-OB1 (29 PRO them)))))
	      (31 . .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's now run the following query to find pronominal objects (pro-obj.q)
on the above sentence.

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: NP-OB*

nodes_only: f

query: (NP-OB* iDoms PRO)
</pre>
</blockquote>

This gives the following output:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
They would have told you if you had visited them.
*~/
/*
11 NP-OB2:  11 NP-OB2, 12 PRO
28 NP-OB1:  28 NP-OB1, 29 PRO
*/
(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 NP-SBJ (3 PRO They))
	      (5 MD would)
	      (7 HV have)
	      (9 VBN told)
	      (11 NP-OB2 (12 PRO you))
	      (14 PP (15 P if)
		     (17 CP-ADV (18 C 0)
				(20 IP-SUB (21 NP-SBJ (22 PRO you))
					   (24 HVD had)
					   (26 VBN visited)
					   (28 NP-OB1 (29 PRO them)))))
	      (31 . .)))
/*

*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

The query matches the two pronouns in the one token and therefore
reports 2 hits and 1 token.  But what if we want to restrict the second
query to only the boundary nodes that match the first query?  In other
words, what if we want to find only pronominal objects in matrix clauses
with subjects that precede at least two verbs (without writing a single
query to that effect)?  This can be done by setting the values of
"nodes_only" and "remove_nodes" in 2vb.q to "t", resulting in 2vb-mod.q.

<blockquote>
<pre>
nodes_only: t

remove_nodes: t

node:  IP-MAT*

query:     (IP-MAT* iDoms NP-SBJ*)
       AND (NP-SBJ* hasSister BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|VB[DP]|MD)
       AND (NP-SBJ* precedes BE[DP]|DO[DP]|HV[DP]|VB[DP]|MD)
       AND (NP-SBJ* hasSister BE|BEN|DO|D[AO]N|HV|H[AV]N|VB|VA[GN])
       AND (NP-SBJ* precedes BE|BEN|DO|D[AO]N|HV|H[AV]N|VB|VA[GN])
</pre>
</blockquote>

The relevantly different output of 2vb-mod.q is as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
( (1 IP-MAT (2 NP-SBJ (3 PRO They))
	    (5 MD would)
	    (7 HV have)
	    (9 VBN told)
	    (11 NP-OB2 (12 PRO you))
	    (14 PP (15 P if)
		   (17 CP-ADV (18 C 0)
			      (20 IP-SUB RMV:you_had_visited...)))
	    (31 . .))
  ) 
</pre>
</blockquote>

Running pro-obj.q on the output of 2vb-mod.q results in the following
output; again, only the relevant different parts are shown.

<blockquote>
<pre>
/*
11 NP-OB2:  11 NP-OB2, 12 PRO
*/
(0  (1 IP-MAT (2 NP-SBJ (3 PRO They))
	      (5 MD would)
	      (7 HV have)
	      (9 VBN told)
	      (11 NP-OB2 (12 PRO you))
	      (14 PP (15 P if)
		     (17 CP-ADV (18 C 0)
				(20 IP-SUB RMV:you_had_visited...)))
	      (22 . .)))
/*
FOOTER
  source file, hits/tokens/total
  NULL			1/1/1
*/
</pre>
</blockquote>

Because "remove_nodes: t" removes the subordinate clause, the query can
match only the pronoun in the matrix clause - as desired.  the result
block therefore contains only 1 line rather than 2, and the number of
hits reported is again 1 rather than 2.
