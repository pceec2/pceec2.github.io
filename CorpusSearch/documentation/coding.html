<p>
Coding queries are used to create input for multivariate analysis
programs like Varbrul; general statistical programming environments like
S, Splus, and R; and statistical analysis packages like Datadesk, JMP,
SAS, and SPSS.  They are extremely powerful and flexible tools.  In
particular, they allow us to circumvent the difficulties inherent in
implementing OR and NOT.

<p>
Coding query files must have names that end in the extension <b>.c</b>.
By default, their output has the same basename as the coding query file,
but with the extension <b>.cod</b>.  The basename of the output file
(but not the .cod extension) can be changed with the
same <a href="installing.html#out-switch">the "out" switch</a> as for
ordinary query files.

<blockquote>
<pre>
CS foo.c bar.psd                    &larr; output = foo.cod

CS foo.c bar.psd -out bar.cod
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The command file for a coding query follows the same conventions as for
an ordinary search query, except that the command specification
is <b>coding_query:</b> (rather than <b>query:</b>).  In addition, the
contents of the command specification essentially consist of multiple
ordinary queries, as described in more detail below.

<ul>
<li>Preamble
    <ul>
    <li>Node specification (obligatory)
    <li>"Ignore" commands (optional)
    <li>Output format commands (optional)
    <li>Reference to <a href="def.html">definition file</a> (optional)
    </ul>
<li>Command specification (obligatory)
</ul>

The output file of a coding query contains every token of the input
file, with a coding node inserted at every boundary node as the first
daughter of that node.

<h3>Sample command specification</h3>

The command specification for a coding query consists of the
command <b>coding_query:</b> following by a list of coding columns.

<blockquote>
<pre>
coding_query:

column_number: {
                 label-1: condition(s)
                 label-2: condition(s)
                 .
                 .
                 .
               }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is a sample coding file that generates a coding string with four
columns.

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: IP-*

coding_query:

1: {
        spe: (IP-*SPE* iDoms NP-SBJ*)
        -:   ELSE
   }

2: {
        mat: (IP-MAT* iDoms NP-SBJ*)
        sub: (IP-SUB* iDoms NP-SBJ*)
        inf: (IP-INF* iDoms NP-SBJ*)
        -:   ELSE

   }

3: {
        neg: (IP* iDoms NEG)
        pos: (IP* iDoms !NEG)
        -:   ELSE
   }

4: {
        \1: (NP-SBJ* domsWords 1)
        \2: (NP-SBJ* domsWords 2)
        \3: (NP-SBJ* domsWords> 2)
        \0: ELSE
   }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p> In this example, column 1 of the coding string will contain "spe" if
<tt>IP-*SPE* iDoms NP-SBJ*</tt>. If not, the column will contain "-", as
specified by the ELSE condition (used only in coding queries).  In the
absence of an explicit ELSE condition, if none of the stated conditions
for the column are met, CorpusSearch fills the column by default with
"_" (underscore).

<p>
The conditions for each column are evaluated in order.  As soon as a
condition is met, the appropriate value is added to the coding string,
and CorpusSearch moves on to the next column.  Depending on the input
data and the logical relationships among the conditions being evaluated,
the order in which they appear in the query can have an effect on the
coding string.  For instance, if sentences can contain both "ne" and
"not", then the following conditions will code "ne ... not" sentences 
as "ne".

<blockquote>
<pre>
3: {
        ne:  (IP* iDoms NEG) AND (NEG iDoms ne)
        not: (IP* iDoms NEG) AND (NEG iDoms not)
        pos: (IP* iDoms !NEG)
        -:   ELSE
   }
</pre>
</blockquote>

Reversing the order of the "ne" and the "not" conditions would lead to
the "ne ... not" sentences being coded as "not".  Of course, if desired,
it is possible to distinguish the "ne ... not" cases from the simple
"ne" and the simple "not" cases with conditions along the following
lines:

<blockquote>
<pre>
3: {
        ne-not:     (IP* iDoms [1]NEG) AND ([1]NEG iDoms ne)
                AND (IP* iDoms [2]NEG) AND ([2]NEG iDoms not)
        ne:         (IP* iDoms NEG) AND (NEG iDoms ne)
        not:        (IP* iDoms NEG) AND (NEG iDoms not)
        pos:        (IP* iDoms !NEG)
        -:          ELSE
   }
</pre>
</blockquote>

In this query, the order of the simple "ne" and simple "not" conditions
has no effect on the coding of the "ne ... not" sentences (provided, of
course, that the "ne-not" condition precedes the other two).

<p>
When numerals (0-9) are used as values in a coding string, they must be
escaped with backslash ("\") in the query, as illustrated for column 4
in the sample file.  In the coding string, the numerals appear without
the backslash.

<a name="cod">
<h3>Sample output</h3>

As mentioned earlier, the output file of a coding query contains every
token of the input file, with a coding node inserted at every boundary
node as the first daughter of that node.  Coding nodes have the form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(CODING-&lt;node_label> &lt;coding_string>)
</pre>
</blockquote>

The "node_label" suffix of the CODING node is the full label of the
current instance of the node boundary.  For instance, if the node
boundary is IP*, and the particular instantiation is IP-SUB-PRN-SPE,
then the label for that IP's CODING node is CODING-IP-SUB-PRN-SPE.  If a
sentence token contains more than one instance of the boundary node, the
output token will contain multiple coding nodes.

<p>
Here is what an output token resulting from the sample coding query from
the previous section would look like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/~*
They do not know the value of a dollar.
*~/

( (IP-MAT (CODING-IP-MAT -:mat:neg:1)
	  (NP-SBJ (PRO They))
          (DOP do)
          (NEG not)
          (NP-OB1 (D the)
                  (N value)
		  (PP (P of)
		      (NP (D a)
			  (N dollar))))
	  (. .)))
</pre>
</blockquote>

<a name="search">
<h3>Searching coding strings</h3> 

Coding strings may be searched using the
"<a href="search-functions.html#column">column</a>" function.  For
instance, the following query would find the sample coded sentence
above:

<blockquote>
<pre>
query:  (CODING-IP-MAT* column 2 mat|sub)
</pre>
</blockquote>

Coding queries can themselves search already existing coding strings.
For instance, assume a coded corpus with three columns.  Column 1 codes
whether the clause-initial constituent is the subject ("subj"), the
finite verb ("verb"), or the direct object ("obj").  Columns 2 and 3
code the same information for the second and third constituents in the
sentence.  The following coding query could then be run on the coded
corpus to classify sentences by clause type based on the information in
the already existing three columns:

<blockquote>
<pre>
4: {
     svo:     (CODING-IP* column 1 subj) 
          AND (CODING-IP* column 2 verb) 
          AND (CODING-IP* column 3 obj) 
     sov:     (CODING-IP* column 1 subj) 
          AND (CODING-IP* column 2 obj) 
          AND (CODING-IP* column 3 verb) 

     osv: ...
     ovs: ...
     vos: ...
     vso: ...
     -:   ELSE
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The query for column 4 must be stored in a coding query file distinct
from the one for columns 1-3 and run separately.  If all four queries
are combined in a single coding query file, CorpusSearch will code the
input file, but it will assign its default elsewhere value "_" to column
4 throughout, since the input file doesn't contain the CODING nodes
referenced by the conditions for column 4.

<a name="print_only">
<h3>Extracting coding strings</h3>

A command file containing only the following command specification
(without a <a href="command-file.html#preamble">preamble</a>) extracts
all of the coding strings in a coded file:

<blockquote>
<pre>
print_only: CODING*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The resulting output file has the extension <b>.ooo</b>.

<p>
The trailing asterisk on CODING is necessary because of the suffix on
each CODING node that specifies its associated syntactic category.
Coding strings for particular categories can be extracted with a
"print_only" command that makes specific reference to those categories.
For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
print_only: CODING-IP*

print_only: CODING-IP-MAT*
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In coded files generated by older versions of CorpusSearch (before
version 74), coding strings lacked node label suffixes.  For such files,
the trailing asterisk is not necessary:

<blockquote>
<pre>
print_only: CODING
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is generally useful to append a sentence token's ID information to
each extracted coding string.  This can be done with the following
command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
add_IDs: t
</pre>
</blockquote>

In the resulting output file, each coding string is followed by an "@"
sign, which in turn is followed by the ID information.  For instance:

<blockquote>
<pre>
1182:verse:v2:fullNP:transitive@ROLAND,3.102
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><img src="hand.GIF">
<td>When exporting the coding string, "@" needs to be added to the list
    of column delimiters (or it needs to be replaced by ":").

<h3>Manually editing coding strings</h3>

In general, the coding strings that CorpusSearch generates completely
algorithmically are used "as is" as input to further statistical
analysis.  But in connection with certain research questions, it is
desirable to encode information about properties that are not generally
annotated in the corpus.  In such cases, it is possible to edit the
coding strings by hand.  For instance, a coding query might be
formulated to generate a column for information concerning a noun
phrase's discourse status ("old", "new", etc.), filling it with a
default elsewhere value ("-"), the statistically most likely value, or
whatever value seems most useful.  This column can then be reviewed and
corrected by hand, and the resulting file can form the input to further
CorpusSearch searches or to statistical analysis.

<p>
<b>Best practice:</b> In the situation just described, the wisest course
is to add the information <u>to (a copy of) the corpus itself</u>.  For
instance, discourse status could be indicated by adding "-OLD" or "-NEW"
to existing NP labels (NP-SBJ-OLD, NP-OB1-NEW, etc.).  The work required
to add the information manually is the same, whether the information is
added to the corpus annotation or to the coding string.  The information
is safer in the annotation (it can't be accidentally overwritten by
accidentally running CorpusSearch on the corpus), and once it is
represented there, it is easy to add it algorithmically to the coding
string with appropriate coding queries.

<a name="tricks">
<h3>Tricks of the trade</h3>

<ul>
<li>CorpusSearch generates columns in the output in numerical order
    regardless of their order in the query.  In other words, the
    following coding file results in the same output when applied to the
    same input as when columns 1 and 2 are listed in ascending numerical
    order.

<blockquote>
<pre>
coding_query:

2: { label(s): condition(s) }
1: { label(s): condition(s) }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>The same file can be coded sequentially with different coding query
    files and different boundary node choices.  For statistical
    analysis, the coding strings can all
    be <a href="#extract">extracted</a> together or separately by
    individual label.

<p>
<li>The two properties just discussed can be exploited in situations
    where it is desirable to generate certain columns with one choice of
    boundary node or "ignore" nodes, and other columns with some other
    choice.  In such a situation, the input file can be coded with two
    (or more) separate coding queries along the following lines.
    Running coding file 1 results in four columns.  CorpusSearch codes
    Columns 1 and 4 according to the conditions associated with those
    columns.  It generates columns 2 and 3 and fills them with the
    default value "_" (underscore)

<p>
Coding file 1:

<blockquote>
<pre>
node: {shared-boundary-node}

ignore_nodes: {ignore-list-1}

coding_query:

1: { label(s): condition(s) }
4: { label(s): condition(s) }
</pre>
</blockquote>

The output of coding file 1 can then be coded using coding file 2.  (For
the purposes under consideration, the two coding files share the same
boundary node, but that is not formally necessary.)  CorpusSearch now
codes columns 2 and 3 according to the specifications for those columns.
In addition, it codes a fifth column in the ordinary way.

<p>
Coding file 2:
<blockquote>
<pre>
node: {shared-boundary-node}

ignore_nodes: {ignore-list-2}

coding_query:

2: { label(s): condition(s) }
3: { label(s): condition(s) }
5: { label(s): condition(s) }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>Coding a corpus using different boundary nodes provides information
    about the structures of different syntactic domains.  In general,
    one eventually wants to combine this information under a single
    CODING node for statistical analysis.  This can be done by running
    a <a href="revision.html">corpus revision query</a> with an
    appropriate <a href="revision.html#concat">concat</a> command on the
    coded file(s).

<p>
<li>Adding information about external (sociolinguistic) variables to a
    coding string is particularly simple if each token in the corpus is
    associated with the appropriate information (as is the case, for
    instance, in the PCEEC).

<blockquote>
<pre>
// date of composition (for PCEEC, where each token includes metadata)
4: {
        ____:  (LETTER column 3 _*)
      \1410: (LETTER column 3 1410*)
      \1411: (LETTER column 3 1411*)
      \1412: (LETTER column 3 1412*)
      \1413: (LETTER column 3 1413*)
      \1414: (LETTER column 3 1414*)
      \1415: (LETTER column 3 1415*)
      \1416: (LETTER column 3 1416*)
      ....
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other corpora, the information can be imported indirectly by means of
reference to information in a token's ID, as in the following examples.
Note that numeric codes need to be "escaped" with a backslash.

<blockquote>
<pre>
// date of author's birth
